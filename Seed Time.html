<h3>THREE</h3>

<h3>Seed-Time</h3>

<p>She&#8217;d thought, running, stumbling up through the moor, with that livid flush on her cheek, up through the green of the April day with the bushes misted with cobwebs, <i>I&#8217;ll never go back, I&#8217;ll never go back, I&#8217;ll drown myself in the loch!</i> Then she stopped, her heart it seemed near to bursting and terribly below it moved something, heavy and slow it had been when she ran out from Blawearie but now it seemed to move and uncoil. Slow, dreadfully, it moved and changed, like a snake she had once seen up on this hill, and the sweat broke out on her forehead. Had anything happened with it? Oh God, there couldn&#8217;t be anything! If only she hadn&#8217;t run so, had kept herself quiet, not struck as she&#8217;d done, deaved and angry and mad she had been!</p>

<p>Sobbing, she fell to a slow walk then, her hand at her side, and through the gate into the moorland went with slow steps, the livid flush burning still on her cheek, she felt it was branded there. Tears had come in her eyes at last, but she wouldn&#8217;t have them, shook them off, wouldn&#8217;t think; and a pheasant flew up beneath her feet, <i>whirroo!</i> as she came to the mere of the loch. She bent over there through the rushes, raising her hands to her hair that had come all undone, and parted it from her face and looked down at her face in the water. It rippled a moment, it was brown with detritus, at first she could see nothing of herself but a tremulous amorphousness in the shadow of the rushes; and then the water cleared, she saw the flush below her cheek-bone, her own face, strange to her this last month and stranger now.</p>

<p>Below in Kinraddie the carts were rattling up every farm-road, driving out dung to the turnip-planting, somewhere there was a driller on the go, maybe it was Upperhill&#8217;s, the clank was a deafening thing. Nine o&#8217;clock in the morning and here up on the hill she was, she didn&#8217;t know where to go or where to turn.</p>

<p>There were the Standing Stones, so seldom she&#8217;d seen them this last nine months. Cobwebbed and waiting they stood, she went and leant her cheek against the meikle one, the monster that stood and seemed to peer over the water and blue distances that went up to the Grampians. She leant against it, the bruised cheek she leaned and it was strange and comforting&#8212;stranger still when you thought that this old stone circle more and more as the years went on at Kinraddie, was the only place where ever she could come and stand back a little from the clamour of the days. It seemed to her now that she&#8217;d had feint the minute at all to stand and think since that last September day she&#8217;d spent up here, caught and clamped and turning she&#8217;d been in the wheel and grind of the days since father died.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But at the time a thing fine and shining it had been, she hadn&#8217;t cared if folk deemed her heartless and godless&#8212;fine she thought it, a prayer prayed and answered, him dead at last with his glooming and glaring, his whistlings and whisperings. <i>Chris, do this,</i> and <i>Chris, do that</i> it went on from morn till night till but hardly she could drag herself to the foot of the stairs to heed him.</p>

<p>But a worse thing came as that slow September dragged to its end, a thing she would never tell to a soul, festering away in a closet of her mind the memory lay, it would die sometime, everything died, love and hate; fainter and fainter it had grown this year till but half she believed it a fancy, those evening fancies when father lay with the red in his face and his eye on her, whispering and whispering at her, the harvest in his blood, whispering her to come to him, they&#8217;d done it in Old Testament times, whispering <i>You&#8217;re my flesh and blood, I can do with you what I will, come to me, Chris, do you hear?</i></p>

<p>And she would hear him and stare at him, whispering also, <i>I won&#8217;t,</i> they never spoke but in whispers those evenings. And then she&#8217;d slip down from his room, frightened and frightened, quivering below-stairs while her fancies raced, starting at every creak that went through the harvest stillness of Blawearie house, seeing father somehow struggling from his bed, like a great frog struggling, squattering across the floor, thump, thump on the stairs, coming down on her while she slept, that madness and tenderness there in his eyes.</p>

<p>She took to locking her door because of that wild fear. The morning of the day she woke to find him dead she leaned out from her bedroom window and heard Long Rob of the Mill, far ayont the parks of Pessie&#8217;s Knapp, out even so early, hard at work with his chaving and singing, singing <i>Ladies of Spain</i> with a throat as young and clear as a boy&#8217;s. She had slept but little that night, because of the fear upon her and the tiredness, but that singing was sweet to hear, sweet and heart-breaking, as though the world outside Blawearie were singing to her, telling her this thing in the dark, still house could never go on, no more than a chance and an accident it was in the wind-loved world of men.</p>

<p>She got into her clothes then, clearer-headed, and slipped down to the kitchen and put on the kettle and milked the kye and then made breakfast. Below the windows the parks stood cut and stooked and trim, Ellison and Chae and Long Rob had done that, good neighbours John Guthrie had, had he never aught else. There came no movement from father&#8217;s room, he was sleeping long, and setting the tray with porridge and milk she hoped he&#8217;d have nothing to say, just glower and eat, she&#8217;d slip away then.</p>

<p>So she went up the stair and into his room without knocking, he hated knocking and all such gentry-like notions, she put down the tray and saw he was dead. For a moment she looked and then turned to the curtains and drew them, and took the tray in her hand again, no sense in leaving it there, and went down and ate a good breakfast, slowly and enjoyingly she ate and felt quiet and happy, even though she fell fast asleep in her chair and awoke to find it gone nine. She lay and looked at her outspread arms a while, dimpled and brown, soft-skinned with the play of muscles below them. Sleep? She could sleep as she chose now, often and long.</p>

<p>Then she tidied the kitchen and found a spare sheet and went out to the hedge above the road and spread the sheet there, the sign she&#8217;d arranged with Chae should she need him. In an hour or so, out in his parks he saw it and came hurrying up to Blawearie, crying to her halfway up <i>Chris, lass, what&#8217;s wrong?</i> Then only she realized she hadn&#8217;t yet spoken that day to a soul, wondered if her voice would shake and break, it didn&#8217;t, was ringing and clear as a bell crying down to Chae, <i>My father&#8217;s dead.</i></p>

<p>It was fair a speak in Kinraddie, her coolness, she knew that well but she didn&#8217;t care, she was free at last. And when Mistress Munro, her that came to wash down the corpse, poked out her futret face and said, <i>A body would hardly think to look at you that your father was new dead,</i> Chris looked at the dark, coarse creature and saw her so clearly as she&#8217;d never done before, she&#8217;d never had time to look at a soul through her own eyes before, Chris-come-here and Chris-go-there. Not a pringle of anger she felt, just smiled and said <i>Wouldn&#8217;t you, now, Mistress Munro?</i> and watched her at work and watched her go, not caring a fig what she thought and did. Then she roused herself for a while, free yet she could hardly be for a day or so, and got ready the big room for Auntie Janet and her man to sleep in, medals and all, when they came down to the funeral.</p>

<p>Down the next day they came, the two of them, Auntie as cheery as ever, Uncle as fat, he&#8217;d another bit medal stuck on his chain; and when they saw she wasn&#8217;t sniftering or weeping they put off the long decent faces they&#8217;d set for her sight, and told her the news, Dod and Alec did fine and had sent their love. And Auntie said they must sell up the things at Blawearie and Chris come and bide with them in the North, some brave bit farmer would soon marry her there.</p>

<p>And Chris said neither yea nor nay, but smiled at them, biding her time, waiting till she found if a will had been left by father. Chae Strachan and old Sinclair of Netherhill saw to the funeral, old Sinclair moving so slow up the road, you&#8217;d half think he&#8217;d stop and take root, clean agony it was to watch him, and his face so pitted and old, father had been young by the like of him. And Mr. Gibbon came over to see her, he&#8217;d been drinking a fell lot of late, folk said, maybe that accounted for the fact that as he crossed the twilit brae he was singing out loud to himself, Auntie heard the singing and ran up and out and hid in the lithe of a stack to try and make out what he sang. But he left off then and left her fair vexed, she said later she could have sworn it was a song they sang in the bothies about the bedding of a lad and a lass.</p>

<p>But Chris didn&#8217;t care, keeping that secret resolve she&#8217;d made warm and clean and unsoiled in her heart, taking it out only alone to look at it, that old-time dream of hers. She&#8217;d never looked at herself so often or so long as now she did, the secret shining deep in her eyes, she saw her face thinner and finer than of yore, no yokel face it seemed. So she cared nothing for Mr. Gibbon and his singing, the great curly brute and his breath that smelt so bad, he went up with her to father&#8217;s room where father lay in his coffin, in a fine white shirt and a tie, his beard combed out and decent and jutting up, you&#8217;d say in a minute he&#8217;d raise those dead eyelids and whisper at you.</p>

<p>Down on his knees the minister went, the great curly bull, and began to pray, Chris hesitated a minute and looked at the floor, and then, canny-like, when he wasn&#8217;t seeing her, dusted a patch and herself knelt down. But she didn&#8217;t heed a word he was saying, honeysuckle smell was drifting in on the air from the night, up on the hills the dog of some ploughman out poaching was barking and barking itself to a fair hysteria following the white blink of some rabbit&#8217;s tail, in the closing dark she could see across the brae&#8217;s shoulder the red light of Kinraddie House shine like a quiet star. So the curly bull prayed and boomed beside her, it was what he was paid for, she neither listened nor cared.</p>

<p>And that brought the funeral, it was raining early in the dawn when they woke, a fine drizzle that seeped and seeped from the sky, so soft and fine you&#8217;d think it snow without whiteness; there was no sun at all at first but it came up at last, a red ball, and hung there so till ten o&#8217;clock brought up the first of the funeral folk, and that was Chae, and his father-in-law, syne Ellison and Maitland in a gig they loosed in the corn-yard, setting the sholtie to graze. And Ellison cried out, but low and decent, <i>I&#8217;ll leave him here, me dear, sure he&#8217;ll be all right, won&#8217;t he?</i> and Chris smiled and said <i>Fine, Mr. Ellison,</i> and he goggled his eyes, Irish as ever, you could never change Erbert Ellison, not even for the worse, folk said.</p>

<p>Next there came a whole drove of folk, the factor, the minister, Cuddiestoun with his ill-marled face like a potato-park dug in coarse weather, but a fine white front, new-starched, to cover his working sark, and cuffs that fair chafed his meikle red hands, right decent, and he&#8217;d on fine yellow boots on his meikle feet. Rob of the Mill and Alec Mutch came next, you could hear their tongues from the foot of Blawearie brae, folk were affronted and went out and cried <i>Wheest-wheest!</i> down to them, and Rob called back <i>What is&#8217;t?</i> and faith! it would have been better if they&#8217;d been left alone, what with the wheesting and whispering that rose.</p>

<p>But they were real good, Rob bringing a bottle of whisky, Glenlivet it was, and Alec a half-bottle, they whisked them over to Uncle Tam when nobody looked; or anyway not a body but looked the other way and spoke, canny-like, of the weather. The kitchen was fair crowded, so was the room, like a threshing-day, folk sat and each had a dram, Mr. Gibbon said <i>Spirits? Yes, thank you, I&#8217;ll have a drop,</i> there&#8217;d have been barely enough to go round but for Rob and Alec. Then they heard another gig come up the hill, it was Gordon&#8217;s from Upperhill, him and his foreman. Uncle Tam winked at the whisky. <i>You&#8217;ll have a dram, Upperhill, you and your man?</i> but Mr. Gordon said, sniffy-like, <i>I hardly think it shows respect and Ewan&#8217;s tee-tee as well.</i></p>

<p>Long Rob of the Mill sat next the door, he winked at Chris and then at Ewan Tavendale, Ewan turned fair red and said nothing. So he hadn&#8217;t a dram, he&#8217;d have liked one fine, Chris guessed, and felt mean and pleased and shy, and then gave herself a shake inside, what did it matter to her? Then the minister looked at his watch and the undertaker came in about, and then last of all, they hadn&#8217;t expected the poor old stock, there was Pooty on the doorstep, he&#8217;d on a clean collar and shirt and an old hat, green but well-brushed; and when Uncle whispered if he&#8217;d have a dram he said <i>Och, ay, it&#8217;s the custom, isn&#8217;t it?</i> and had two.</p>

<p>The undertaker had gone up by then, Uncle with him, folk followed them one by one and came down, syne Auntie beckoned Chris to the neuk of the stair and said <i>Would you like to see him before he&#8217;s screwed down?</i></p>

<p>Uncle Tam and Long Rob of the Mill were there and as Chris went in Long Rob said <i>Well, well, good-bye, Blawearie man,</i> and shook father&#8217;s hand, his eyes looked queer when he turned away, he said <i>He was a fine neighbour</i> and went out and closed the door. Chris stood and looked at her father, seeing him so plain as never in life she&#8217;d seen him, he&#8217;d been over-restless for that and quick enough he&#8217;d have raged at you had you glowered at his face like this.</p>

<p>Still enough now, never-moving there in the coffin, he seemed to have changed already since he died, the face sunk in, it wasn&#8217;t John Guthrie and yet it was. Uncle whispered behind her, him and the undertaker, and then Auntie was beside her. <i>They&#8217;re to screw it down now, kiss your father, Chris.</i> But she shook her head, she couldn&#8217;t do that, the room was still as they looked at her, for a moment she felt almost sick again as in those evening hours when <i>that</i> in the coffin had lain and whispered that she should lie with it. Then she just said <i>Good-bye, father,</i> and turned from him and went down to her own room and put on her coat and hat, it wasn&#8217;t decent for a quean to go to a funeral, folk said, but in Blawearie&#8217;s case there was no son or brother to see him into the kirkyard.</p>

<p>Chae and Long Rob and Ellison and Gordon carried the coffin down to the stair-foot, and settled it on their shoulders there, and went slow with it out through the front door then; and the rain held off a little, wind blowing in their faces, though, as they held down the hill. Behind walked the Reverend Gibbon, bare-headed, all the folk were bare-headed but Chris, Long Rob and Chae stepping easily and cannily, Ellison as well, but Gordon quivering at his coffin corner, he&#8217;d have done better with a dram to steady him up. But Chris walked free and uncaring, soon as the burial was over she&#8217;d be free as never in her life she&#8217;d been, she lifted her face to the blow of the wet September wind and the world that was free to her.</p>

<p>Then it was that she saw Ewan Tavendale walked beside her, he glanced down just then and straight and fair up into his eyes she looked, she nearly stumbled in the slow walk because of that looking. They came to the turnpike then, there Ewan took Gordon&#8217;s corner and Alec Mutch Ellison&#8217;s, and these two fell back beside the minister, but Chae and Long Rob shook their heads when others offered to change with them, they&#8217;d manage fine.</p>

<p>The rain still held off, presently the wind soughing down the Howe died away and a little peek of sun came through, not down the Denburn it came but high up in the hill peaks, the lost, coarse ground where never a soul lived or passed but some shepherd or gillie, you could see them far off, lone and lonesome there on a still, clear day. Maybe so the dead walked in a still clear, deserted land, the coarse lands of death where only the chance wanderer showed his face, Chris thought, and the dead lapwings wheeled and cried against another sun. Then she ceased from that, startled out a moment from the calm that had come to her with her father&#8217;s dying&#8212;daft to dream these things now when she planned so much. Step, step, steadily and cannily went Long Rob and Chae, Chae getting bald and sandy in the crown, but Rob still with the corn hair clustered thick and the great moustaches swinging from his cheeks as they turned up the road that led to the kirkyard.</p>

<p>Then the sun went again, it was eleven o&#8217;clock perhaps, and Chris raised her eyes and saw through the trees the blinded windows of the Mains, the curtains were all drawn, decent-like, in respect for the funeral; and she felt a queer, sick thrill just below her left breast, not ill or sick, but just like a starting of the blood there, as though she&#8217;d leant on that place too long, and it had grown numb. It was dark under the yews, they dripped on the coffin and Long Rob, then there came a pattering as they passed by slow beneath, and Chris saw the long, oval leaves suddenly begin to quiver, it was as though a hand shook them, and through the leaves was the sky, it had blackened over and the rain was coming driving in a sheet down the brae from the Grampian haughs. It came and whipped the wet skirts about her legs, she saw Long Rob and Chae and Ewan stagger and then stand leaning against the drift, and then go on, not a soul put on his hat, there&#8217;d be bad colds by night and ill-tunes over this funeral yet.</p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t decent to think, but what did it matter to her? She wished she were back in Blawearie, and hoped the minister would not be over long-winded when he said his say. There was the grave-digger, a man from the Mains, a big scrawny childe who lived ill with his wife, folk said, he had his coat collar up and came out below the eaves of the kirk and motioned them along a path. And ben it they went, then Chris saw the grave, red clay and bright it was, not as she&#8217;d expected his grave somehow to be, they weren&#8217;t burying him in mother&#8217;s grave. For that land was over-crowded, folk said that every time the grave-digger stuck his bit spade in the ground some bone or another from the dead of olden time would come spattering out, fair scunnering you. But this was an old enough bit as well, right opposite rose the stone with the cross-bones, maybe all the dead bodies had long mouldered away into red clay here, clay themselves, and folk were glad they left the earth free for new-comers.</p>

<p>Uncle had come to her elbow then and he stood with her, the others stood back, it was strange and silent but for the soft patter of the rain on the yews and the Reverend Gibbon shielding his Bible away from the wet drive of it, beginning to read. And Chris listened, her head bent against the rain&#8217;s whisper, to the words that promised Resurrection and Life through Jesus Christ our Lord, who had died long syne in Palestine and had risen on the third day and would take from that thing that had been John Guthrie quick, and was now John Guthrie dead, the quickness and give it habitation again.</p>

<p>And Chris thought of her dream looking up at the coarse lands of the hills and thinking of the lands of death, was that where Christ would meet with father? Unco and strange to think, standing here in the rain and listening to that voice, that father himself was there in that dark box heaped with the little flowers that folk had sent, father whom they were to leave here happed in red clay, alone in darkness and earth when the night came down. Surely he&#8217;d be back waiting her up in Blawearie, she&#8217;d hear his sharp, vexed voice and see him come fleetly out of the house, that red beard of his cocked as ever at the world he&#8217;d fought so dourly and well&#8212;</p>

<p>Somebody chaved at her hand then, it was the grave-digger, he was gentle and strangely kind, and she looked down and couldn&#8217;t see, for now she was crying, she hadn&#8217;t thought she would ever cry for father, but she hadn&#8217;t known, she hadn&#8217;t known this thing that was happening to him! She found herself praying then, blind with tears in the rain, lowering the cord with the hand of the grave-digger over hers, the coffin dirling below the spears of the rain. <i>Father, father, I didn&#8217;t know! Oh father, I didn&#8217;t KNOW!</i></p>

<p>She hadn&#8217;t known, she&#8217;d been dazed and daft with her planning, her days could never be aught without father; and she minded then, wildly, in a long, broken flash of remembrance, all the fine things of him that the years had hidden from their sight, the fleetness of him and his justice, and the fight unwearying he&#8217;d fought with the land and its masters to have them all clad and fed and respectable, he&#8217;d never rested working and chaving for them, only God had beaten him in the end.</p>

<p>And she minded the long roads he&#8217;d tramped to the kirk with her when she was young, how he&#8217;d smiled at her and called her his lass in days before the world&#8217;s fight and the fight of his own flesh grew over-bitter, and poisoned his love to hate. <i>Oh father, I didn&#8217;t know!</i> she prayed again, and then that was over, she was in the drive of the rain, hard and tearless, the grave-digger was pointing to the ground and she picked up a handful of soft, wet earth, and heard the Reverend Gibbon&#8217;s voice drone out <i>Dust to dust, ashes to ashes,</i> and leant over the grave and dropped the wet earth; and then the grave-digger was throwing in the turf, the coffin rang as though it were hollow, she stared at it till Uncle had her by the elbow, speaking to her, and so was the Reverend Gibbon but she couldn&#8217;t hear them at first; and folk were to say she must have been real fond of her father after all, the best of a coarse bit family in the end.</p>

<p>And then she was walking back through the kirkyard and the folk at the gate were stopping to shake her hand, Long Rob and Chae to say they&#8217;d aye help her, and Ellison, kind and solemn and Irish, and old Sinclair dripping in the rain, he should never have been out in a day like this. The last was Ewan Tavendale, he said <i>Ta-ta, Chris,</i> his hand was wet meeting hers as her own hand was, but he put up his left hand as well as his right and held both of hers a minute; and he didn&#8217;t look ashamed and shy any more, but as though he was so sorry he&#8217;d help her in any way, not only the ways he could.</p>

<p>That was the last of them she saw and the end of father&#8217;s funeral. Back in Blawearie Auntie Janet made her strip from her clothes and get into bed, <i>God be here, it&#8217;s you that&#8217;ll be next in your grave!</i> she cried. And Chris slept throughout the remainder of that day, undreaming, she didn&#8217;t wake till late in the night, Blawearie listening and hearkening about her. And then she was afraid, awfully afraid, sitting up in bed and hearkening to that Something that walked the house with sharp, quick footsteps, running so fleetly up the stairs, impatient and unresting, a shadow with footfalls that were shadows; and into the night and far towards the dawn it roamed the house of Blawearie till the cocks were crowing and Uncle and Auntie moving, and Chris didn&#8217;t feel afraid at all by then, only lay and wept softly for the father she&#8217;d never helped and forgot to love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the next forenoon the lawyer man came down from Stonehaven, it was Peter Semple, folk called him Simple Simon but swore that he was a swick. Father had trusted him, though, and faith! you&#8217;d be fell straight in your gait ere John Guthrie trusted you. Not that he&#8217;d listened to advice, father, he&#8217;d directed a will be made and the things to be set in that will; and when Mr. Semple had said he was being fell sore on some of his family father had told him to mind his own business, and that was a clerk&#8217;s.</p>

<p>So Mr. Semple drew up the will, it had been just after Will went off to the Argentine, and father had signed it; and now the Blawearie folk sat down in the parlour, with whisky and biscuits for Mr. Semple, to hear it read. It was short and plain as you please, Chris watched the face of her uncle as the lawyer read and saw it go white in the gills, he&#8217;d expected something far different from that. And the will told that John Guthrie left all his possessions, in silver and belongings, to his daughter Christine, to be hers without let or condition, Mr. Semple her guardian in such law matters as needed one, but Chris to control the goods and gear as she pleased. And folk were to say, soon as Kinraddie heard of the will, and faith! they seemed to have heard it all before it was well out of the envelope, that it was an unco will, old Guthrie had been fair spiteful to his sons, maybe Will would dispute his sister&#8217;s tocher.</p>

<p>The money was over three hundred pounds in the bank, it was hard to believe that father could have saved all that. But he had; and Chris sat and stared at the lawyer, hearing him explain and explain this, that, and the next, in the way of lawyers: they presume you&#8217;re a fool and double their fees. Three hundred pounds! And now she could do as she&#8217;d planned, she&#8217;d go up to the College again and pass her exams and go on to Aberdeen and get her degrees, come out as a teacher and finish with the filthy soss of a farm. She&#8217;d sell up the gear of Blawearie, the lease was dead, it had died with father, oh! she was free and free to do as she liked and dream as she liked at last!</p>

<p>And it was pity now that she&#8217;d all she wanted she felt no longer that fine thrill that had been with her while she made her secret plans. It was as though she&#8217;d lost it down in Kinraddie kirkyard; and she sat and stared so still and white at the lawyer man that he closed up his case with a snap. <i>So think it well over, Christine,</i> he said and she roused and said <i>Oh, I&#8217;ll do that;</i> and off he went, Uncle Tam drew a long, deep breath, as though fair near choked he&#8217;d been <i>Not a word of his two poor, motherless boys!</i></p>

<p>It seemed he&#8217;d expected Alex and Dod would be left their share, maybe that was why he&#8217;d been so eager to adopt them the year before. But Auntie cried <i>For shame, Tam, how are they motherless now that I&#8217;ve got them? And you&#8217;ll come up and live with us when you&#8217;ve sold Blawearie&#8217;s furnishings, Chris?</i> And her voice was kind but her eyes were keen, Chris looked at her with her own eyes hard, <i>Ay, maybe,</i> and got up and slipped from the room, <i>I&#8217;ll go down and bring home the kye.</i></p>

<p>And out she went, though it wasn&#8217;t near kye-time yet, and wandered away over the fields; it was a cold and louring day, the sound of the sea came plain to her, as though heard in a shell, Kinraddie wilted under the greyness. In the ley field old Bod stood with his tail to the wind, his hair ruffled up by the wind, his head bent away from the smore of it. He heard her pass and gave a bit neigh, but he didn&#8217;t try to follow her, poor brute, he&#8217;d soon be over old for work. The wet fields squelched below her feet, oozing up their smell of red clay from under the sodden grasses, and up in the hills she saw the trail of the mist, great sailing shapes of it, going south on the wind into Forfar, past Laurencekirk they would sail, down the wide Howe with its sheltered glens and its late, drenched harvests, past Brechin smoking against its hill, with its ancient tower that the Pictish folk had reared, out of the Mearns, sailing and passing, sailing and passing, she minded Greek words of forgotten lessons, &Pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha; &rho;&epsilon;&iota;, <i>Nothing endures.</i></p>

<p>And then a queer thought came to her there in the drooked fields, that nothing endured at all, nothing but the land she passed across, tossed and turned and perpetually changed below the hands of the crofter folk since the oldest of them had set the Standing Stones by the loch of Blawearie and climbed there on their holy days and saw their terraced crops ride brave in the wind and sun. Sea and sky and the folk who wrote and fought and were learned, teaching and saying and praying, they lasted but as a breath, a mist of fog in the hills, but the land was forever, it moved and changed below you, but was forever, you were close to it and it to you, not at a bleak remove it held you and hurted you. And she had thought to leave it all!</p>

<p>She walked weeping then, stricken and frightened because of that knowledge that had come on her, she could never leave it, this life of toiling days and the needs of beasts and the smoke of wood fires and the air that stung your throat so acrid, Autumn and Spring, she was bound and held as though they had prisoned her here. And her fine bit plannings!&#8212;they&#8217;d been just the dreamings of a child over toys it lacked, toys that would never content it when it heard the smore of a storm or the cry of sheep on the moors or smelt the pringling smell of a new-ploughed park under the drive of a coulter. She could no more teach a school than fly, night and day she&#8217;d want to be back, for all the fine clothes and gear she might get and hold, the books and the light and learning.</p>

<p>The kye were in sight then, they stood in the lithe of the freestone dyke that ebbed and flowed over the shoulder of the long ley field, and they hugged to it close from the drive of the wind, not heeding her as she came among them, the smell of their bodies foul in her face&#8212;foul and known and enduring as the land itself. Oh, she hated and loved in a breath! Even her love might hardly endure, but beside it the hate was no more than the whimpering and fear of a child that cowered from the wind in the lithe of its mother&#8217;s skirts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And again that night she hardly slept, thinking and thinking till her head ached, the house quiet enough now, without fairlies treading the stairs, she felt cool and calm, if only she could sleep. But by morning she knew she couldn&#8217;t go on with Uncle and Auntie beside her, they smothered her over with their years and their canny supposings. Quick after breakfast she dressed and came down and Auntie cried out, real sharp-like, <i>Mighty be here, Chris, where are you going?</i> as though she owned Blawearie stick and stone, hoof and hide. And Chris looked at her coolly, <i>I&#8217;m away to Stonehaven to see Mr. Semple, can I bring you anything?</i></p>

<p>Uncle Tam rose up from the table then, goggling, with his medals clinking, <i>Away to Stonehive? What are you jaunting there for? I&#8217;ll transact any business you have.</i> Their faces reddened up with rage, she saw plain as daylight how near it lay, dependence on them, she felt herself go white as she looked at them <i>I&#8217;ll transact my own business fine,</i> she said hardly, and called <i>Ta-ta</i> from the door and heard no answer and held down the Blawearie road and ran over the parks to the station, and caught the early scholar&#8217;s train that went to Stonehaven Academy.</p>

<p>It was crowded fell close, there were three-four scholars in the carriage she got in to, she didn&#8217;t know any, they were learning French verbs. And she&#8217;d wanted to go back to things as silly!</p>

<p>They were past Drumlithie and the Carmont then, you could smell the woods of Dunnottar and look out at them from the window, girdling Stonehaven down to its bay, shining and white, the sun was out on the woods and the train like a weasel slipped through the wet smell of them. And there was Stonehaven itself, the home of the poverty toffs, folk said, where you might live in sin as much as you pleased but were damned to hell if you hadn&#8217;t a white sark. She&#8217;d heard Chae Strachan say that, but it wasn&#8217;t all true, there were fell poor folk in Stonehaven as well as the come-ups; and douce folk that were neither poor nor proud and had never a say when Stonehaven boomed of its braveness. And that it did fair often, the Mearns&#8217; capital, awful proud of its sarks but not of its slums and it thought itself real genteel, and a fine seafront it had that the English came to in summer&#8212;daft, as usual, folk said, hadn&#8217;t they a sea in England?</p>

<p>Because it was early in the day and the lawyer&#8217;s office still shut Chris loitered on the road in the tail of the hasting scholars, the little things they were, all legs and long boots, funny how they tried to speak English one to the other, looking sideways as they cried the words to see if folk thought them gentry. Had Marget and she been daft as that?</p>

<p>But the sun was out now on the long Stonehaven streets and Chris went past the Academy down to the market, still at that hour with just a stray cat or so on the sniff around, genteel and toff-like, Stonehaven, cats. Down through a lane she caught a glimmer of the North Sea then or maybe it was the sunlight against the sky, but the smell of the sea came up. And she still had plenty of time.</p>

<p>So she went down to the shore, the tide was out, thundering among the rocks, not a soul on the beach but herself, gulls flying and crying, the sun strong and warm. She sat on a seat in the glow of it and shut her eyes and was happy. Below her feet the ground drummed and trembled with reverberations from that far-off siege of the rocks that the sea was making out there by the point of the bay, it was strange to feel it and be of it, maybe folk there were who felt for the sea as last night she had felt in the rain-drenched fields of Kinraddie. But to her it seemed restless, awaiting and abiding nowhither, not fine like the glens that nestled and listened high up the coarse country, or the parks sun-heavy with clover that waited your feet at evening.</p>

<p>She fell asleep then, she slept there two hours in the sun and woke feeling fresher than she&#8217;d done since father&#8217;s funeral. So hungry also she felt she couldn&#8217;t wait the ending of the business she&#8217;d come on but went into a tea-house up in the square, two women kept it, old bodies they were that moved backward and forward the room, slow and rheumatic. One looked like the cats she&#8217;d seen in the square that morning, sleeked and stroked, the other was thin as a lathe, their tea-room looked scrubbed and clean and their tea had a taste to match. They were sharp and stroked and genteel, Chris thought for the first time then in her life how awful it would be to grow old like them, old maids without men, without ever having lain with a man, or had him kiss you and hold you, and be with you, and have children of his, or the arm of a man when you needed it, kind and steadfast and strong. If she&#8217;d lived her plan to train as a teacher she&#8217;d have grown like them.</p>

<p>She might grow so still! she thought, and daft-like suddenly felt quite feared, she paid for her tea in a hurry and went out to the square again, thinking of herself as an old maid, it wouldn&#8217;t bear thinking about. So she hurried to the office of Simple Simon and a little clerk asked her business, perky-like, and she looked at him coolly and said her business was Mr. Semple&#8217;s. And then she minded the old maids, was she herself one by nature? And in a cold fear she smiled at the clerk, desperately, with her lips and eyes, it was fine, the boy smiled also and blushed and thawed, and said <i>Sit doom, this is fine and comfortable;</i> and pulled out a padded chair for her; and down she sat, light-hearted again. Then the clerk came back and led her through a passage to Semple&#8217;s room, he looked busy enough, with a telephone beside him and heaps of papers, and rows of little black boxes round the shelves. Then he rose and shook hands, <i>Well, well, it&#8217;s Miss Guthrie come up; you&#8217;ve been thinking of the will, no doubt?</i></p>

<p>She told him, Yes, just that; and she was going to live on at Blawearie a while, not roup the gear out at once, could he see to that with the factor?</p>

<p>He stared at her with his mouth fallen open, <i>But you can&#8217;t live there alone!</i></p>

<p>She told him she&#8217;d no such intention, couldn&#8217;t he get her some woman come live with her, some old bit body who&#8217;d be glad of a home?</p>

<p>He said <i>Oh, God, there are plenty of them!</i> and began to chew at his mouser.</p>

<p>She told him it mightn&#8217;t be for more than a month or so, till she&#8217;d made up her mind, just.</p>

<p>He said absent-like, <i>Just? Hell, a woman&#8217;s mind just!</i> and then pulled himself up right sudden as she looked at him hardly and cool. Then he argued a bit, but Chris hardly listened, father&#8217;s will had said she could do what she liked.</p>

<p>And presently, seeing she cared not a fig for him, Semple gave in and said he&#8217;d settle up with the factor, and he knew an old widow body, Melon, he&#8217;d send down to Blawearie the morn.</p>

<p>So Chris said <i>Thank you, good-bye,</i> and went out from the office, cool as she&#8217;d come, the sun was a fell blaze then and the streets chock-a-block with sheep, great droves of them, driven in to the weekly mart. Collies were running hither and yon, silent and cocked of ear, clean and quick as you&#8217;d wish, paying heed to none but shepherd and sheep. Drovers and beasts, they took a good look at Chris both, as she stood in her black clothes watching them; and just as she wondered what she&#8217;d do next, walk down to the sea and sit on a bench till it neared to dinnertime in the hotels, or go up to the station and take the 11.0, a gig going by slowed down of a sudden, a man jumped down and cried back to the driver.</p>

<p>The man that had jumped was the foreman at Upperhill, Ewan Tavendale, the driver old Gordon himself, he looked in a rage about something. And he cried <i>Mind the time then!</i> and gave Chris a sore glower and drove spanking away.</p>

<p>And then Ewan had crossed the pavement and was standing in front of her, he lifted his cap and said, shy-like, <i>Hello!</i> Chris said <i>Hello,</i> and they looked at each other, he was blushing, she minded the last time, she didn&#8217;t like him half as she&#8217;d done at the funeral. He said <i>Are you in for the day?</i> and she mocked him, not knowing why she did that, it wasn&#8217;t decent and father new dead, <i>Och ay, just that.</i> He blushed some more, she felt cool and queerly giddy in a breath, looking at the fool of a lad, folk were glowering at them both they were later to learn, not Gordon only but Ellison: and back the two of them went to Kinraddie and told every soul it was a sore shame there wasn&#8217;t somebody about to heed to the Guthrie girl from the hands of that coarse tink brute, Ewan Tavendale.</p>

<p>But they hadn&#8217;t known that and mightn&#8217;t have cared, suddenly Chris felt herself hungry again, happy as well, not caring about Ewan himself but not wanting either he should leave her and go on to the mart. She said <i>I&#8217;m going up to the Inn for dinner,</i> and he looked at her, still shy, but with a kind of smoulder in the shyness, his eyes like the smoulder of a burning whin&#8212;<i>Maybe we can eat together?</i> And she said, as he turned by her side, <i>Oh, maybe. But what will Mr. Gordon do?</i> And Ewan said he could dance a jig on the head of the mart with sheer rage, for all he cared.</p>

<p>So in they went to old Mother White&#8217;s, not that they saw the old body herself; and there was a fine room to eat in, with white cloths set, and a canary that sang above them, the windows fast closed to the dust and dirt. And they&#8217;d broth, it was good, and the oat-cakes better; and then boiled beef and potatoes and turnip; and then rice pudding with prunes; and then some tea, Ewan found his tongue as they drank the tea and said to-day was his holiday, for he&#8217;d worked all the last Sunday on a job libbing lambs. And Chris said, it was out of her mouth before she thought, <i>So you&#8217;re in no hurry to be back?</i> and Ewan leaned across the table, the smoulder near kindled to a fire, <i>Not unless you should be? What train are you taking up to Kinraddie?</i></p>

<p>And then how it all came about, their planning to spend the day together and their walk to Dunnottar, Chris never knew, maybe neither did Ewan. But half an hour later, Stonehaven a blinding white glimmer behind, Dunnottar in front, they were climbing down the path that led to the island. The air was blind with the splash of the incoming tide, above you the rock rose sheer as the path wound downwards sheer; and high up, crowning the rock were the ruins of the castle walls, splashed with sunlight and the droppings of sea-birds. Gulls there were everywhere, Chris was deafened in the clamour of the brutes, but quiet enough in the castle it proved, not a soul seemed visiting there but themselves.</p>

<p>They paid their shillings and the old man came with them from room to room, a scunner to Ewan, Chris guessed, for his eyes kept wandering, wearied, to her from this ruin and that. In walls little slits rose up, through these it was that in olden times the garrisons had shot their arrows at besiegers; and down below, in the dungeons, were the mouldering clefts where a prisoner&#8217;s hands were nailed while they put him to torment. There the Covenanting folk had screamed and died while the gentry dined and danced in their lithe, warm halls, Chris stared at the places, sick and angry and sad for those folk she could never help now, that hatred of rulers and gentry a flame in her heart, John Guthrie&#8217;s hate. Her folk and his they had been, those whose names stand graved in tragedy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Ewan whispered, <i>Oh, let&#8217;s get out of this,</i> though it was he himself that had planned they come to Dunnottar. So out in the sun, at the shelving entrance, they stood awhile in the cry of the gulls; and then Ewan said <i>Come down to the sea: I know a nook.</i></p>

<p>And they climbed down and then up again, along the cliff-edge, it made you dizzy to look over and down at the incoming wash of froth, and sometimes, far under their feet, there rose a loud <i>boom!</i> like a gun going off. Ewan said that the rocks were sometimes hollow and the water ran far below the fields, so that ploughmen ploughed above the sea and in stormy weather they&#8217;d sometimes see their furrows quiver from that storm that raged under their feet. So they came to a crumbling path, it seemed to fall sheer away, a seagull sailed up to meet them, and Ewan with his feet already out of sight turned back and asked, <i>You&#8217;ll not be dizzy?</i> And Chris shook her head and followed him, it seemed to her between sea and sky, down and down, and then Ewan was gripping her ankle, she swung almost loose for a moment, looking down in his face, it was white and strained, then her foot and hand caught again, Ewan called that it wasn&#8217;t much further; and they got to the bottom and sat and looked at each other on a ledge of sand.</p>

<p>The sun poured in there, the tide whispered and splashed and threw out its hands at them on the sand, but it didn&#8217;t come further up. And Chris saw that the place was closed in, you couldn&#8217;t see a thing of the coast but the rocks overhanging, and only a segment of the sea itself a mile or so out a boat had tacked, it flashed its wings like a wheeling gull; and Ewan was sitting beside her, peeling an orange.</p>

<p>They ate it together and Chris took off her hat, she felt hot and uncouth in her sad black clothes. And suddenly, for no reason, she thought of a time, years before, when she&#8217;d been trampling blankets for mother a fine summer day in May, and had taken off her skirts and her mother had come out and laughed at her, <i>You&#8217;d make a fine lad!</i> It was as though she heard mother speak, she looked up and around, daftly, dazed-like a moment, but there was not a soul near but Ewan Tavendale lying on an elbow, looking at the sea, the sun in his face, young and smooth with its smouldering eyes. And she found she didn&#8217;t mislike him any longer, she felt queer and strange to him, not feared, but as though he was to say something in a moment that she knew she couldn&#8217;t answer. And then he said it, blushing, but his smouldering eyes didn&#8217;t waver, <i>Chris, do you like me a bit?</i></p>

<p><i>Can&#8217;t thole you at all, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out lazing in this place together.</i></p>

<p>But a nervousness came on her, not that she feared him, she&#8217;d known all along she was safe with Ewan as Mollie with Will in those long-gone days of the court at Drumlithie. Only, it was as though her blood ran so clear and with such a fine, sweet song in her veins she must hold her breath and heark to it; and for the first time she knew the strange thing her hand was, held there dripping sand, it seemed as though all her body sat a little apart from herself, and she looked at it, wondering. So it was that she knew she liked him, loved him as they said in the soppy English books, you were shamed and a fool to say that in Scotland. Ewan Tavendale&#8212;that it should be him! And then she minded something, it didn&#8217;t matter at all, but she wanted to know for all that. <i>Ewan, was it true that story they told about you and old Sarah Sinclair?</i></p>

<p>It was as though she had belted him in the face. He went white then, funnily white leaving brown the red tan in the little creases of his face that the coarse field weather had made; and he sat up, angrily, and glowered at her, the great black cat, so sleeked and quick to anger. And the feeling she&#8217;d had for him, that dizziness that made earth and sea and her heart so light, quite went from her. She said <i>Oh, I don&#8217;t want to know,</i> and began to hum to herself; and then Ewan reached out his hand and gripped her arm, it hurt, he said <i>Damn well listen now that you&#8217;ve asked me.</i> And it was awful, awful and terrible, she didn&#8217;t want to listen to him, covering her face with her hands, he went on and on and then stopped at last&#8212;<i>Now you&#8217;re frightened, frightened that a woman should feel like that, maybe some day you&#8217;ll feel it yourself.</i></p>

<p>She jumped to her feet then, angry as him, forgetting to feel ashamed. <i>Maybe I will, but when I do I&#8217;ll get a better man than you to serve me!</i> And before he could answer that she had caught up her hat and was up the cliff path so quick she didn&#8217;t know how she did it, her fingers and feet were nimble and sure, she heard Ewan cry below her and paid no need. He was barely half-way up when she reached the top and looked down, and then the rage quite went from her, she leaned over the edge instead, holding down her hand, and he caught it and smiled, and they stood and panted and smiled one at the other, fools again as they&#8217;d been in the market-square of Stonehaven.</p>

<p>But suddenly Ewan whipped out his watch, <i>God, it must be getting fell late,</i> and as he said it the sunshine went. Chris raised her head and saw why, they&#8217;d been sitting down there in the last of it, the gloaming was down on the countryside and the noise of the gulls rising up through the mirk. Ewan caught her hand and they ran by the cliff-edge of the gloaming-stilled parks, there were great dappled kye that stopped their grazing to look; and up in front, dark and uncanny, they saw Dunnottar rise on its rock. And then they reached the main road and slowed down, but she still left her hand in Ewan&#8217;s.</p>

<p>And in Stonehaven they caught by the skin of the teeth the six o&#8217;clock train, the mart was long over and folk gone home. In the carriage were only themselves all the way to Kinraddie, Ewan sat on the opposite seat, she liked him sit there, liked him not wanting to hold her hand, she&#8217;d have hated him touch her now. And they didn&#8217;t say a word till they neared Kinraddie, and then he said <i>Chrissie! Tired?</i> and she said <i>Losh, no, and my name&#8217;s Chris, Ewan.</i> Then she saw him blush again in the flicker of the gaslight; and a strange, sweet surge of pity came on her, she leant over and patted his knee, he was only a boy in spite of his Sarah Sinclair.</p>

<p>But she thought of Sarah all the same that night, lying listening in bed to the coming of the rain again, a wet winter it promised the Howe. So women were like that when they didn&#8217;t have the men they wanted?&#8212;many of them maybe like that, hiding it away even from themselves till a summer of heat drove on here and there to such acts as affronted Kinraddie. But she didn&#8217;t feel affronted, it was maybe because she was over young, had read over many of the books, had been the English Chris as well as this one that lay thinking of Ewan; and the old ways of sinning and winning, having your own pleasure and standing affronted at other folk having theirs, seemed often daft to her. Sarah Sinclair might well have obliged her and met with some other lad than Ewan that August night; but then she wasn&#8217;t to know Chris Guthrie would ever lie and think of him in her bed, hearing the batter of the rain against her window and the swish of the great Blawearie trees.</p>

<p>It was then, in a lull of the swishing, she heard the great crack of thunder that opened the worst storm that had struck the Howe in years. It was far up, she thought, and yet so close Blawearie&#8217;s stones seemed falling about her ears, she half-scrambled erect. Outside the night flashed, flashed and flashed, she saw Kinraddie lighted up and fearful, then it was dark again, but not quiet. In the sky outside a great beast moved and purred and scrabbled, and then suddenly it opened its mouth again and again there was the roar, and the flash of its claws, tearing at the earth, it seemed neither house nor hall could escape. The rain had died away, it was listening&#8212;quiet in the next lull, and then Chris heard her Auntie crying to her <i>Are you all right, Chrissie?</i> and cried back she was fine. Funny Uncle Tam had cried never a word, maybe he was still in the sulks, he&#8217;d plumped head-first in when he&#8217;d heard of the old woman that Semple was sending to help keep house in Blawearie. They were off to Auchterless the morn, and oh! she&#8217;d be glad to see them go, she&#8217;d enough to do and to think without fighting relations.</p>

<p>The thunder clamoured again, and then she suddenly sat shivering, remembering something&#8212;Clyde and old Bob and Bess, all three of them were out in the ley field there, they weren&#8217;t taken in till late in the year. Round the ley field was barbed wire, almost new, that father had put up in the Spring, folk said it was awful for drawing the lightning, maybe it had drawn it already.</p>

<p>She was out of bed in the next flash, it was a ground flash, it hung and it seemed to wait, sizzling, outside the window as she pulled on stockings and vest and knickers and ran to the door and cried up <i>Uncle Tam, Uncle Tam, we must take in the horses!</i> He didn&#8217;t hear, she waited, the house shook and dirled in another great flash, then Auntie was crying something, Chris stood as if she couldn&#8217;t believe her own ears. Uncle Tam was feared at the lightning, he wouldn&#8217;t go out, she herself had best go back to her bed and wait for the morning.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t wait to hear more than that, but ran to the kitchen and groped about for the box of matches and lighted the little lamp, it with the glass bowl, and then found the littlest lantern and lighted that, though her fingers shook and she almost dropped the funnel. Then she found old shoes and a raincoat, it had been father&#8217;s and came near to her ankles, and she caught up the lamp and opened the kitchen door and closed it quick behind her just as the sky banged again and a flare of sheet lightning came flowing down the hill-side, frothing like the incoming tide at Dunnottar. It dried up, leaving her blinded, her eyes ached and she almost dropped the lantern again.</p>

<p>In the byre the kye were lowing fit to raise the roof, even the stirks were up and stamping about in their stalls. But they were safe enough unless the biggings were struck, it was the horses she&#8217;d to think of.</p>

<p>Right athwart her vision the haystacks shone up like great pointed pyramids a blinding moment, vanished, darkness complete and heavy flowed back on her again, the lantern-light seeking to pierce it like the bore of a drill. Still the rain held off as she stumbled and cried down the sodden fields. Then she saw that the barbed wire was alive, the lightning ran and glowed along it, a living thing, a tremulous, vibrant serpent that spat and glowed and hid its head and quivered again to sight. If the horses stood anywhere near to that they were finished, she cried to them again and stopped and listened, it was deathly still in the night between the bursts of the thunder, so still that she heard the grass she had pressed underfoot crawl and quiver erect again a step behind her. Then, as the thunder moved away&#8212;it seemed to break and roar down the rightward hill, above the Manse and Kinraddie Mains,&#8212;something tripped her, she fell and the lantern-flame flared up and seemed almost to vanish; but she righted it, almost sick though she was because of the wet, warm thing that her body and face lay upon.</p>

<p>It was old Bob, he lay dead, his tongue hanging out, his legs doubled under him queerly, poor brute, and she shook at his halter a minute before she realized it was useless and there were still Bess and Clyde to see to. And then she heard the thunder and clop of their hooves coming across the grass to her, they loomed suddenly into the light of the lamp, nearly running her down, they stood beside her and whinnied, frightened and quivering so that her hand on Bess&#8217;s neck dirled as on the floor of a threshing-machine.</p>

<p>Then the lightning smote down again, quite near, though the thunder had seemed to move off, it played a great zig-zag over the field where she stood with the horses, and they pressed so near her she was almost crushed between them; and the lantern was pressed from her hand at last, it fell and went out with a crash and a crinkle of breaking glass. She caught Bess&#8217;s bridle with one hand, Clyde&#8217;s with another, and the lightning went and they began to move forward in the darkness, she thought she was in the right direction but she couldn&#8217;t be sure. The next flash showed a field she didn&#8217;t know, close at hand, with a high staked dyke, and then she knew she had gone utterly wrong, it was the dyke on the turnpike.</p>

<p>The thunder growled satisfiedly and Clyde whinnied and whinnied, she saw then the reason for that, right ahead was the waving of a lantern, it must be Uncle come out to look for her at last, she cried <i>I&#8217;m here!</i> and a voice cried <i>Where?</i> She cried again and the lantern came in her direction, it was two men climbing the dyke. The horses started and whinnied and dragged her forward and then she found herself with Chae Strachan and Ewan, they had seen to their own horses on Upperhill and the Knapp, and had met and had minded hers on Blawearie; and up they had come to look for them. In the moment as they recognized one the other the lightning flared, a last sizzling glow, and then the rain came again, they heard it coming far up in the moors, it whistled and moaned and then was a great driving swish. Chae thrust his lantern upon Ewan, <i>Damn&#8217;t man, take that and the lass and run for the house! I&#8217;ll see to the horse!</i></p>

<p>Ewan caught Chris under the arm, he swung the lantern in his other hand, they ran for a gate that led to the turnpike, the horses galloped behind them, Chae dragging at their halters and cursing them; and the rain overtook them as they gained the road, it was a battering wet hand that beat at them, Chris was soaked to the skin in a moment.</p>

<p>But in another they&#8217;d gained the new biggings of Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, there shone a light in the kitchen, Ewan opened the door and pushed Chris in, <i>Bide here and I&#8217;ll off and help Chae!</i> He disappeared into the blackness, the door closed behind him, Chris went forward into the kitchen and the glow of the fire. She felt daft and deaf in the sudden silence and out of the rain, in the stillness of the new kitchen with its meikle clock wagging against the wall, and its calendars and pictures all spaced about, it looked calm and fine. Then she realised how wetted she was and took off the raincoat, it rained a puddle on the kitchen floor, she was dressed below only in knickers and vest, she&#8217;d not remembered that!</p>

<p>There came a rattle and clatter outside in the close as the men ran to the house, Chris slipped on the coat again and was tugging at the buttons as the two came stamping in. Chae cried,

<i>Damn&#8217;t, Chris, get out of that coat, you must fair be soaked. Here, I&#8217;ll stir up the fire, the old wife&#8217;s in bed, she&#8217;d sleep through a hundred storms.</i></p>

<p>He bent over the fire then, poking it up, Chris found Ewan beside her, his hair black with the rain, the great cat, to help her off with her coat. She whispered, <i>I can&#8217;t, Ewan, I&#8217;ve nothing on below!</i> and he blushed as red as a girl himself, and dropped his hands, and looked like a foolish boy so that she lost her own shyness at once, and told the same thing to Chae when he turned him round. He laughed at her with his twinkling eyes, <i>What, nothing at all?&#8212;Well, not very much, Chae&#8212;Them come ben and I&#8217;ll get you a coat of the wife&#8217;s, you can slip into that.</i></p>

<p>The rain was pelting on the roof as she followed him through to Mistress Strachan&#8217;s new parlour, it sounded loud enough to wake the dead let alone her that had been Kirsty Sinclair. Chae opened the wardrobe and brought out a fine coat, Mistress Strachan&#8217;s best for the Sunday, lined and fine and smelling of moth-balls; and then a pair of her slippers. <i>Get out of your things, Chris lass, and bring them to dry. I&#8217;ll have something warm for you and Ewan to drink.</i></p>

<p>Left alone with the candle she wished she&#8217;d asked for a towel; Chae was kind but a man had no sense. But she managed without, though stripping from vest and knickers and stockings felt like parting wetly from her own skin, almost, so soaked she had been. Then she put on the coat and slippers and gathered up the wet under-things and went through with them to the kitchen; and there was Chae one side of the fire with a bottle of whisky at his elbow, making toddy, and Ewan at the other, with his coat off, warming his hands and looking at the door for her to come ben. They didn&#8217;t look at her over-close, either of them, Chae pulled in one chair for her to sit on and another for her things to dry on, and when she&#8217;d spread them out he stopped in his toddy-making and said <i>Damn&#8217;t, Chris, was that ALL you&#8217;d on?</i> And she nodded and he said <i>You&#8217;ll have your death of cold, sit closer</i>&#8212;</p>

<p>And that was fine, sitting next to Ewan, close to the blaze of the meikle larch logs that Chae had put on, they were swack with resin. Syne Chae had the toddy made and he handed a glass to Ewan first, as was right with a man, and another to Chris, with three spoonfuls of sugar in it, Mistress Strachan might have had something to say about that if she&#8217;d seen such wastry. But she was fast asleep up in Chae&#8217;s bed, and knew nothing of it all till the morning, she made up for it then, folk said she accused both Chae and Ewan of cuddling and sossing with the Guthrie quean all the hours of the night.</p>

<p>So that was the ongoing there was that night of lightning, nor was it the only one in Kinraddie, for the lightning, and maybe it was the big flash Chris had seen as she gained the brae leading down to the horses, drove a great hole through the Manse spare bedroom, and let in the rain and fair ruined the place. Folk said that when the Reverend Gibbon heard the bolt strike the house, he&#8217;d been awake and listening, he dived like a rabbit below the blankets and cried <i>Oh, God, keep it away from me!</i> Which wasn&#8217;t the kind of conduct you&#8217;d have expected from a minister, but there was a fair flock of folk the lightning scared that night in one place or another, Jock Gordon at Upperhill ran to his mother&#8217;s bedroom and wept all over the counterpane there like a bairn.</p>

<p>And Alec Mutch of Bridge End went out about midnight to look for his sheep, but he was half-drunk when he went and got drunker every minute as he chaved about, not seeing a thing. And at last he came to a big stook out in the corn-parks and crawled into that, it was a stook that stood near the turnpike, and feint the thing else was seen of him till late the next morning when the postman was going by and the sun was shining fine, and out Alec&#8217;s face and meikle lugs were stuck from the stook and gave the postman such a turn in the wame he was nearly sick on the spot.</p>

<p>But of all that Chris knew nothing, she&#8217;d plenty to think of with her own bit ploys. For after the rain cleared and her under-things dried she went through to the parlour and got in them again, and into the raincoat of father&#8217;s, and Chae lighted a lantern, fair yawning with sleep was Chae, and Ewan was to guide home to Blawearie both Chris and the horses. So out to the night again, the rain had cleared and freshened it, there was a wind from off the sea blowing in the stars, and clouds like the drifting of great women&#8217;s veils, fisher-wives&#8217; veils, across the sad faces of the coarse high hills.</p>

<p>Then the horses champed in the courtyard, Ewan had their halter-ropes in his hand, Chris was beside him swinging the lantern, they cried <i>Ta-ta!</i> to Chae and Chae nearly uncovered the back of his gums, so sleepy he was, poor stock; and he started to cry something to Chris about coming up the morn and seeing to old Bob whom the lightning had killed, they&#8217;d be able to sell him to the knacker in Brechin. But a yawn put an end to whatever he&#8217;d to say, it hardly mattered, it was morn already, you could see far down by Bervie a band of greyness stroke the horizon, as though an idle finger stroked it there on a window-pane.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, with a nicker now and then and long snortings through their nostrils, the horses, glad to be roaded up to Blawearie, Ewan big by the side of Chris, she hadn&#8217;t realised before how big he was. He said nothing at all, except shy-like, once <i>Are you warm enough?</i> and she laughed and said

<i>Fine,</i> she&#8217;d never again be shy with Ewan Tavendale. And it seemed to her even then it would be long before she forgot this walk through the night that was hardly night at all, an hour poised on the edge of the morning like a penny on its rim, the flutter of the wind in their faces and the wet country sleeping about them, it smelt like Spring, not a morning in fore-winter.</p>

<p>Then she was yawning, stopping from that, it was still a bit way to the house, she wondered if Uncle or Auntie had known she went out to the horses in the lightning. But she needn&#8217;t have worried, not a thing they&#8217;d guessed and didn&#8217;t till the morning came. Blawearie was black as the inside of a lum-hat when they climbed to it, the kye quietened down, it hardly seemed home at all she had come to, a strange place this, with Ewan beside her. She opened the stable door for him, he led in the horses and made a shake-down, and came out and closed and barred up the door, she held him the lantern to see to that. And then he turned round, they were standing there in the close, his arms went round her, below her arms, and she said <i>Oh, don&#8217;t!</i> and turned away her face; and he did nothing and she turned up her face to him again, peeping to see what he did.</p>

<p>Dark still it was but she saw his teeth, laughing at her, and then she put down the lantern and somehow resistance went from her, she hadn&#8217;t wanted to resist, he was holding her close to him, kissing her, her cheeks and the tip of her nose because he couldn&#8217;t see well in the darkness. And then he waited a moment and his lips came to hers and they were trembling as her own were, she wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh in a breath, and have him hold her for ever, so, in the close, and his trembling lips that came into hers, sweet and terrible those lips in hers.</p>

<p>There was a great power of honeysuckle that year, the smell of it drenched all the close in wet, still weather, it perfumed the night and that kiss, she wouldn&#8217;t ever forget them both though she lived unkissed again till she died. And then she knew they were near to other things, both of them, Ewan&#8217;s breath was quicker than it should, he&#8217;d stopped from kissing her that kiss in the lips, his lips were urgent on her neck; and she let him, standing so still, it was warm and sweet, she was his, he hers, for all things and everything, she never wanted better than that.</p>

<p>And then, in that ultimate moment, close at hand Chris heard the Blue Wyandotte, already so cocky that he was, stir on his ree, he gave a bit squawk before he stirred and peeked for the day he would crow so lustily. Somehow that stirring brought Chris to her senses, she wasn&#8217;t afraid, only this could wait for another night&#8217;s coming, it was sweet and she wanted it to live and last, not snatch it and fumble it blindly and stupidly. And she caught Ewan&#8217;s hand and kissed him, he stopped with that kiss of hers on his cheek, his cheek with the soft brown skin; and she whispered <i>Wait, Ewan!</i></p>

<p>He let her go at once, shamed of himself, he had little need to be that, she saw him troubled and uncertain in the dim light and put her arms about him and kissed him again and whispered

<i>Come down and see me to-morrow evening,</i> and he said <i>Chris, when&#8217;ll you marry me?</i> and she quivered strangely and sweetly as he said that, his hands holding her again, but gently. And then something happened, and the happening was a yawn, she yawned as though her head would fall off, she couldn&#8217;t stop yawning; and a laugh came in the middle of it and that only made it worse. And Ewan let go of her again, maybe he was nearly in a rage at first, and then he yawned himself, they stood like two daft geese, yawning, and then they were laughing together, holding hands, not laughing too loud in case they&#8217;d be heard. And five minutes after that Ewan was far on his way to the steading of Upperhill and Chris lying in her bed, she&#8217;d hardly touched it when she thought of Ewan, she wanted to think of him long and long, only next minute she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t seem that minute had passed when she heard Uncle Tam come chapping at her door, fair testy, <i>Come away, come away, now; there&#8217;s a fire to light and your Auntie wants her tea.</i> She sat up in bed, still sleepy and dazed, <i>All right, Uncle Tam,</i> and yawned and didn&#8217;t move for a minute, remembering the things of the night and day she&#8217;d forgotten in sleep. And then she threw off the blankets and got out from the bed, and stretched till each muscle was taut and quivering, she felt light and free and fine, not at all Chris Guthrie with the grave brown face and heavy hair, light and free as a feather; and without a stitch on she did a little dance at her window in the splash of early sun that came there&#8212;what a speak for Kinraddie were she seen! And she was singing to herself as she dressed and went slipping downstairs, Uncle was kneeling at the kitchen fire, like a cow with colic, and fair sour in the face. <i>You&#8217;re in fine tune this morning,</i> he glowered and she said <i>Ay, Uncle, I&#8217;m that, give the sticks to me,</i> and had them out of his hand and the fire snapping into them all in a minute.</p>

<p>Uncle went out to the close then, to look over the fields for the horses, and came back at a run, his little quoit medals swinging and clashing from his meikle belly, <i>Mighty, Chris, there&#8217;s no sign of a horse!</i> She didn&#8217;t turn round, just said <i>You could hardly have looked in the stable,</i> and heard him stop and breathe a great breath, and then go out again. And not a word more he said at the breakfast, he went up to their room to pack; but Auntie asked how the horses came to be in and was told Chris had done it herself, with Chae Strachan and Ewan to help. She seemed fair shamed to hear that, Auntie Janet, but angry as well, she whisked round the house like a wasp, <i>Ah well, it&#8217;s plain you&#8217;ve no use for your relatives here, I only pray you don&#8217;t come to disaster.</i> And Chris said <i>That&#8217;s awfully fine of you, Auntie,</i> and that made her madder than ever, but Chris didn&#8217;t care, she didn&#8217;t care though all the world, all Kinraddie and the Howe, went mad and choked itself with its bootlaces over the things that had been between her and Ewan.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#8217;t in a rage it was fair in a stir of scandal by postman time, Kinraddie. Not a thing but it knew of her day in Stonehaven with that coarse tink brute, Ewan Tavendale, they&#8217;d been seen to go wandering out to Dunnottar together, they&#8217;d hidden away down in a hole by the sea&#8212;what did they that for if they&#8217;d nothing to hide?</p>

<p>The postie told this to Auntie while Chris meated the chickens, Auntie fair grew worked up and forgot to rage, near crying she was as she told the story to Chris. How funny were folk! Chris thought, standing and fronting that trembling face. You knew them, saw through them, tied them up in little packets stowed away in your mind, labelled COARSE or TINKS or FINE; and they came tumbling from the packets at the very first shake, mixed and up-jumbled, she&#8217;d never known a soul bide neat and sure in his packet yet. For here was Auntie near crying because she thought her niece had been raped by Ewan Tavendale overnight, ashamed for her, sorry for her, fair set to carry her off to Aberdeen and cover her shame. But Chris said <i>There&#8217;s nothing to cry about yet, Auntie Janet, Ewan and I haven&#8217;t lain together. We&#8217;ll wait till we&#8217;re married,</i> and laughed at her Auntie&#8217;s face, it was funny and pitiful both at once. And Auntie said

<i>He&#8217;s to marry you then?</i> and Chris said she hoped so, but you never knew, and Auntie fell in a fearsome stew again, it wasn&#8217;t fair to torment her like that, but that was the mood of Chris that morning.</p>

<p>Then Chae Strachan came up from the Knapp and looked at old Bob lying dead in his park. He shook his head over him, he doubted if the knacker would pay more than a pound&#8212;the closest muckers in Scotland, knackers, and <i>that</i> was fair saying a lot. Syne he promised to drive Auntie and her man to the station, and went back to the Knapp for his gig and was up and waiting before you could blink. And Chris helped her relatives up in the gig, and sent them her love to her brothers, and off the gig spanked, they looked over their shoulders and saw her stand laughing, she didn&#8217;t care a button, coarse quean that she was.</p>

<p>And fair a relief was the riddance, the place to herself again; and then as she watched the gig whip round the corner into the turnpike it came on her that it wasn&#8217;t <i>again,</i> it was just the first time! Blawearie was hers, there wasn&#8217;t a soul in the place but herself, nobody had a right to come near it but if she allowed. The honeysuckle was blinding sweet in the sun, wet still and as she stood beside it and buried her face in it, laughed into it, blushed in it, remembering herself of the night before. And Ewan would be up to see her soon, to see her &#8230; and she wouldn&#8217;t think of more! she had hundreds of things to do.</p>

<p>By noon she had dinner set for the old wife sent from Stonehaven. And then she heard Chae&#8217;s gig come driving up to Blawearie and there was Chae and an old bit body, fair tottery she seemed as she got from the gig, with a black mutch on and a string bag gripped in her hand. But when she reached the ground she was none so tottery, she said that the heights aye feared her legs; and she looked Chris all over as though to make sure of her, living or dead, and asked <i>Where&#8217;ll I put my box, Mem?</i>

And Chris blushed for shame that any old soul should <i>Mem</i> at her, <i>Maybe Chae will carry it up for us?</i> And Chae said <i>Och, fine that,</i> and hoisted the old tin thing on his shoulder, and went swaggering into the house, and Mrs. Melon followed after and Chris turned to Chae&#8217;s gig.</p>

<p>By the time Chae came down she had nearly unyoked it, Chae cried <i>Damn&#8217;t Chris, what&#8217;s on?</i> and she told him <i>Dinner, you&#8217;re to stay for that.</i> So he was fell pleased, though he hummed and hawed a minute about rousting back to the Knapp. But she smiled at him, that way she had done to the boy in Semple&#8217;s office, and Chae stared at her and wound up his waxed mouser and twinkled his eyes and gave her shoulder a slap, <i>Lord, Chris, they&#8217;ll right soon be after you, the lads, with your eyes</i>

<i>like that!</i> And he gave a bit sigh as though, other times, other ways, he&#8217;d have headed the band himself.</p>

<p>So into the kitchen he came and sat himself down with old Mistress Melon, and Chris dished up the rabbit stew and they had a great dinner, Mistress Melon was a funny old wife as soon as she saw you put on no airs. She&#8217;d a great red face as though she&#8217;d just unbended from a day&#8217;s hard baking, and pale blue eyes like a summer sky, and faded hair that had once been brown, and Chris soon saw she was maybe the biggest gossip that had ever come into Kinraddie, and faith! that meant the challenging of many a champion.</p>

<p>But her stories of Stonehaven had a lilt and a laugh, and the best was the one of the Provost that had lost his stud in his tumbler when speaking to a teetotal gathering. And Chae said that was a fine one, <i>Damn&#8217;t, mistress, when I was in Africa</i> . . . and he told them a story of a man he knew, a black he&#8217;d been, real brave, and he found a diamond, on his own ground too, but as soon as the British heard of it they sent to arrest him for&#8217;t. And what had that black childe done? Swallowed the damned thing and nothing of him could the British make, and they couldn&#8217;t arrest him, and the black got his diamond back in a day or so in the course of nature, they were awful constipated folk, the blacks.</p>

<p>All the time he was telling the story Chae had been tearing into his rabbit and oat-cake; and soon&#8217;s he&#8217;d finished one plate he took a look over the pot and cried <i>God, that was right fine, Chris quean. Is there more on the go?</i> Chris liked that, it was fine to have somebody that was hungry and liked his meat and didn&#8217;t make out he was gentry or polite, there was less politeness about Chae than about a potato fork.</p>

<p>Mistress Melon was eating right heartily too, and syne Chae told them another story, about a lion that he and the black head childe had hunted, they&#8217;d been awful chief together&#8230; . And Mistress Melon asked <i>What, you and the lions?</i> and winked at Chris, but Chae wasn&#8217;t a bit put out, he just said <i>Damn&#8217;t it no, mistress, me and the head man,</i> and went on with the story again, it was plain Mistress Melon thought he was a bit of a liar till suddenly, casual-like, Chae opened the front of his sark and finished up, <i>And that was the bit momento the damned beast left on me.</i> Syne they saw the marks on his chest, the marks of great raking claws they were they had torn fair deep and sure, and Chae&#8217;s dark body-hair didn&#8217;t grow in them. So Mistress Melon was fair stammy-gastered at that; and said so to Chris when Chae was gone.</p>

<p>Soon as that was Chris set to arranging with the Melon wife how the two of them would partition the work, Mistress Melon could do the cooking and cleaning, Chris preferred the outside, she&#8217;d milk and see to the kine; and they&#8217;d get on bravely, no doubt. Mistress Melon was a fell good worker in spite of her awful tongue, she&#8217;d cleared up the dinner things and washed them and put them away ere Chris was well out of the house. Then down on her knees she went and was scrubbing the kitchen floor, Chris was glad enough to see her at that, she hated scrubbing herself. If only she&#8217;d been born a boy she&#8217;d never had such hatings vexing her, she&#8217;d have ploughed up parks and seen to their draining, lived and lived, gone up to the hills a shepherd and never had to scunner herself with the making of beds or the scouring of pots. But neither would she ever have had Ewan hold her as last night he had.</p>

<p>And then she blushed and went on in silence with the cleaning of the byre, thinking of his coming and what she would say to him and the thing it was they&#8217;d arrange. Before she knew it the new plan came shaping up bravely in her mind, neat and trim and trig, and when she looked out and saw the gloaming near and went over the close and down through the parks for the kye, she had everything fixed, it didn&#8217;t matter a fig what folk might say.</p>

<p>So when Ewan came in by at last she waited him ben in the parlour, with a great fire kindled there and the two big leather chairs drawn close. It was Mistress Melon that brought him through, her meikle red face fair shaking with ill-fashionce, agog to know what was toward. But Chris just said <i>Thank you, Mistress Melon,</i> and ticed Ewan over to his chair, and took his cap from him and made him sit down and fair closed the door in the old wife&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>It was bright and warm in the room, she turned round and saw her lad sit so; and then she raised her head and saw herself in the long, old mirror of the parlour wall, and thought how she&#8217;d changed, it crept on you and you hardly noticed, in ways you were still as young as the quean with the plaits that had run by Marget to catch the scholar&#8217;s train. But she saw herself then in her long green skirt, long under the knee, and her hair wound in its great fair plaits about her head, and her high cheek-bones that caught the light and her mouth that was well enough, her figure was better still; and she knew for one wild passing moment herself both frightened and sorry she should be a woman, she&#8217;d never dream things again, she&#8217;d live them, the days of dreaming were by; and maybe they had been the best; and there was Ewan waiting for her, the great quiet cat, reddening and turning his head up with its smouldering eyes.</p>

<p>She went to him then and put her hand on his shoulder and before she knew it they were close together and so stayed long after they had finished with kissing, just quiet, in the firelight, his arms about her, her head on his shoulder, watching the fire. And when at last they began to speak she put her hands over his lips, whispering to him to whisper in case Mistress Melon should be listening out by. Maybe she wasn&#8217;t but in the shortest while they heard her go stamping about in the kitchen, singing a hymn fell loud, and that was a bit suspicious.</p>

<p>But they ceased from heeding her soon enough, they&#8217;d a hundred things to plan and discuss, there in the fire-glow, they lit no lamp, Chris listened with her head down-bent as he told her he couldn&#8217;t marry he&#8217;d no more than a hundred pounds saved up, they&#8217;d have to wait. And she told him <i>she</i> had three hundred pounds, no credit to her, it was her father&#8217;s saving, but if she and Ewan married fair soon he could take over Blawearie&#8217;s lease, they could stay where they were, <i>and that would be fine, no need for you any day then to go back through the parks to Upperhill.</i> He kissed her again at that, hurting her lips, but she didn&#8217;t heed, it was fine to be hurt like that; but she wouldn&#8217;t kiss back till he&#8217;d put him his Highland pride in his pouch and muttered <i>All right.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They&#8217;d planned to be married in December and as they&#8217;d planned so the thing worked out without any hitch at all. In November Ewan found and fee&#8217;d a substitute foreman for Upperhill, a quite-like childe James Leslie; and though old Gordon was none so pleased he couldn&#8217;t well afford to fall out with so near a neighbour as the new Blawearie. Chris went into Stonehaven again with Ewan and saw the man Semple, he was fair suspicious, at first, but she argued him soon from that, and he got the lease changed to Ewan&#8217;s name, and well-feathered his own nest in the changing, no doubt.</p>

<p>By then the news was no news, Kinraddie knew all, and when they came from the station that night they met in with Ellison down from the Mains, he&#8217;d been waiting them there to go by and he wouldn&#8217;t have it but that they go up to the house and drink their own healths in a dram. Mistress Ellison was gentry and nice, more gentry than nice, poor thing, she was still no more than a servant quean and fleered and arched to make Chris and Ewan blush, she managed with Ewan. But Chris kept cool as ice, and nearly as friendly, she didn&#8217;t see that a joke was less dirty if a neighbour spoke it. She and Ewan fair quarrelled over that when they left the Mains, it was their first quarrel and she wouldn&#8217;t let him touch her, she said <i>If you like foul stories, I don&#8217;t,</i> and he said, prigging at her, <i>Oh, don&#8217;t be a fool, Chris quean,</i> and she said <i>There&#8217;s no need for you marry a fool, then,</i> and the Highland temper quite went with him then, he flared up like a whin with a match at it, <i>Don&#8217;t be feared, I&#8217;ve no such intention!</i> and off he went, up over the hill through the evening parks.</p>

<p>Chris walked on prim and cold and quick, it was near to sunset, she turned her head, she couldn&#8217;t but help it, to see if he wasn&#8217;t looking back, he wasn&#8217;t; and that was too much, she stopped and cried <i>Ewan!</i> and he wheeled like a shot and came running to her, she was crying in earnest by then, she cried up against his coat while he held her and panted and swore at himself, <i>Oh, Chris, I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you!</i> And she sniffed <i>You didn&#8217;t, it was myself;</i> and they made it all up again. She walked home subdued-like that night, it wouldn&#8217;t be always plain sailing, they&#8217;d awful tempers, both of them. Then she saw the light of Blawearie shine steadfast across the parks and her heart kindled to a queer, quiet warmth at that.</p>

<p>They&#8217;d arranged to be married on New Year&#8217;s Eve, most folk would be free to come that day. For three evenings they sat in Blawearie parlour and wrote their invitations to folk they knew and some they didn&#8217;t, nearly every soul in Kinraddie was asked, they couldn&#8217;t well miss out one of them. And to Auntie and Uncle and Dod and Alec they wrote, and to Ewan&#8217;s friend, McIvor, a Highlandman out of Ross. He hadn&#8217;t any near relatives, Ewan, and faith! they were feint the loss.</p>

<p>Chris knew that some would be sore affronted she should marry so close to her father&#8217;s death, and with all the stir they intended, too. But Ewan said <i>Damn it, you&#8217;re only married once as a general rule, and it won&#8217;t hurt the old man in Kinraddie kirkyard.</i> So when Uncle wrote down from Auchterless that he&#8217;d think black, burning shame to attend such a marriage, Ewan said he could blacken and burn till he was more like a cinder heap than a man, for all they need care.</p>

<p>Chris was sorry they wouldn&#8217;t let her brothers come, but it couldn&#8217;t be helped, she wasn&#8217;t to weep for that. So they planned out a wedding they&#8217;d mind on when they grew old, ordering food enough to feed the French, as the saying went. Mistress Melon near burst her meikle face with amaze as the packages came pouring in; and she spread the story of Chris&#8217;s extravagance out through the Howe, she&#8217;d soon see the end of old Guthrie&#8217;s silver. Folk shook their heads when they heard of that, it was plain that the quean wouldn&#8217;t store the kiln long.</p>

<p>When Ewan went over to see to the banns the Reverend Gibbon tried to read him a lecture about such a display so close to John Guthrie&#8217;s death. But he gave it up quick enough when Ewan began to spit like a cat and say the service he wanted was a wedding, not a sermon. Syne it grew plain they couldn&#8217;t meet so often, Ewan would have to bide at the Upperhill all the day before the marriage. Chris kissed him good-bye that evening and told him to look after himself, and herself looked after him, troubled, knowing the kind of coarse things they might try him with in the bothy. And try they did, but Ewan couped one of them into the midden and threw young Gordon into the horse-trough when that brute was trying the same on Ewan himself; so they let him be, dour devils to handle, those Highlandmen.</p>

<p>And down in Blawearie next day, what with cooking and chaving and tending to beasts, and wrestling with the worry of the barn, it wasn&#8217;t half spruced for the dance, Chris might well have gone off her head if Chae and Long Rob of the Mill hadn&#8217;t come dandering up the road in the afternoon, shy-like, bringing their presents. And Rob&#8217;s was fine, two great biscuit barrels in oak and silver; and Chae&#8217;s was from him and Kirsty, sheets and pillows, kind of Mistress Strachan, that, when you minded how the two of you&#8217;d fallen out over father ill.</p>

<p>And when they heard of the barn they cast off their coats, <i>Leave it to us, Chris lass, just tell&#8217;s what you want;</i> and they set to with ladders and tow and fancy frills and worked till near it was dark, redding up the place, it looked fine as a fairy-palace in a picture-book when they finished. Chae said <i>And who&#8217;s your musician?</i> Chris nearly dropped through the floor with shock, she and Ewan had fair forgot about music. But Chae said it didn&#8217;t matter, he&#8217;d bring his melodeon and Long Rob his fiddle; and faith! if that didn&#8217;t content the folk they were looking for a church parade of the Gordons, not a wedding.</p>

<p>Syne they bade good night to Chris, and they laughed at her, kind-like, and said <i>This time the morn you&#8217;ll be a married woman, Chris, not a quean. Sleep sound to-night!</i> And she laughed back and said <i>Oh, fine that;</i> but she blushed when Long Rob began to glint his grey eyes at her, he&#8217;d have to think of getting married himself, he said, fine it must be to sleep with a slim bit the like of herself those coldrife winter nights. And Chae said <i>Away, Rob, feint the much sleep you&#8217;d give her!</i></p>

<p>And then they cried their good nights again and went off, leaving Chris with such lonesome feeling as she&#8217;d seldom had, all had been done that could be done, she wanted to sleep but couldn&#8217;t sleep; and she wandered from room to room till Mistress Melon was fair upset and cried <i>For God&#8217;s sake gang to your bed, lass, I&#8217;ll tend to the rest; if you don&#8217;t lie down you&#8217;ll look more like a bull for the butcher&#8217;s than a bride the morn.</i> And Chris laughed, she heard her laugh funny and faint-like, and said she supposed so, and went off to her room, but not to bed. She sat by the window, it was a night that was rimed with a frost of stars, rime in the sky and rime on the earth, the Milky Way shone clear and hard and the black trees of Blawearie waved their leafless boughs up against the window, sparkling white with the hoar; and far across the countryside for hours she watched the winking of the paraffin-lights in the farmhouses, till they sank and went out, and she was left in a world that might well have been dead but that she lived.</p>

<p>Strange and eerie it was, sitting there, she couldn&#8217;t move from the frozen flow of thoughts that came to her then, daft things she&#8217;d no need to think on her marriage eve &#8230; that this marriage of hers was nothing, that it would pass on and forward into days that had long forgotten it, her life and Ewan&#8217;s, and they pass also, and the face of the land change and change again in the coming of the seasons and centuries till the last lights sank away from it and the sea came flooding up the Howe, all her love and tears for Ewan not even a ripple on that flood of water far in the times to be. And then she found herself cold as an icicle and got to her feet and at last began to get from her clothes&#8212;strange to think that to-morrow and all the to-morrows Ewan would share her room and her bed with her.</p>

<p>She thought that cool and unwarmed, still in the grip of the strange white dreaming that had been hers, looking down at herself naked as though she looked at some other than herself, a statue like that of the folk of olden time that they set in the picture galleries. And she saw the light white on the satin of her smooth skin then, and the long, smooth lines that lay from waist to thigh, thigh to knee, and was glad her legs were long from the knee to the ankle, that made legs seem stumbling and stumpy, shortness there. And still impersonally she bent to see if that dimple still hid there under her left breast, it did, it was deep as ever. Then she straightened and took down her hair and brushed it, standing so, silly to stand without her night-gown, but that was the mood she was in, somehow it seemed that never again would she be herself, have this body that was hers and her own, those fine lines that curved from thigh to knee hers, that dimple she&#8217;d loved when a child&#8212;oh, years before!</p>

<p>And then a clock began to strike, it struck two, and suddenly she was in a panic to be bedded and snug and herself again; and was in between the sheets in an instant, cuddling herself to some warmth and counting how many hours it would be till morning. And oh! it was still so long!</p>

<p>It came in snow that morning; she looked out from her window and saw it sheeting across the countryside, all silent; but still the daft peewits wheeped and wheeled against the hills, looking for the nests they&#8217;d lost in the harvest and couldn&#8217;t forget. In the race and whip of the great broad flakes the leafless trees stood shivering; but down below Mistress Melon was already at work, Chris heard the clatter of the breakfast things, it was time she herself was into her clothes, there were hundreds of things to do.</p>

<p>Then she took out of the chest of drawers her underthings, there was no need to wait to change them, and looked at them, the silken vest, awful price it had been, and knickers and petticoat, vest, knickers and petticoat all of a shade, blue, with white ribbon; and they looked lovely and they smelt fine, she buried her face in them, so lovely they were and the queer feeling they brought her. And she changed her mind, she couldn&#8217;t wear anything now she&#8217;d be wearing when she was married, she put on her old things and her old skirt and went down the stairs; and there was Mistress Melon smiling at her, <i>How do you feel on your marriage-morn, Chris?</i></p>

<p>And Chris said <i>Fine,</i> and Mistress Melon said that was a good job, too, she&#8217;d known creatures of queans come down fair hysterical, others that just shook with fright, still others that spoke so undecent you knew fine a man&#8217;s bed was no unco place for <i>them.</i> She hoped Chris would be awful happy, no fear of that, and soon have a two-three bairns keep her out of longer. And Chris said <i>You never know,</i> and she ate her porridge and Mistress Melon hers, and they cleared the table and scrubbed the kitchen and then Chris went out and tended the beasts, the very horses seemed to guess there was unco thing on the go, Bess nozzled up against her shoulder; and there in the barn when she peeked in it, right in the middle of the floor, were two great rats, sitting up on their tails, sniffing at each other&#8217;s mouths, maybe kissing, and that was so funny, she tried not to laugh, but gave a choked gurgle and flirt! the rats were out of sight and into their holes.</p>

<p>In the cornyard the hens came tearing about her, mad with hunger, she gave them meat hot from the pot and then a bushel of corn, they liked that fine. But first the little bit Wyandotte got up on the cartshaft and gave a great crow that might have been heard in the Upperhill; and he cocked a bright eye on her, first one eye and then the other, and Chris laughed again.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t feel hurried after that, then the postman came, fell dry, they gave him a dram and he licked his lips and said <i>Here&#8217;s to you, Chris!</i> as blithe to drink to her health as to blacken her character. He&#8217;d brought him two parcels, one was a lovely bedspread from Mistress Gibbon of the Manse, nice of the quiet-voiced English thing, and the other from the Gordons of Upperhill, a canteen of cutlery, full enough of knives and forks and things to keep you cleaning them a week on end and not be finished, said Mistress Melon.</p>

<p>Then up the road came the wife of the grave-digger, Garthmore, him that had buried father. Sore made as always she was, poor thing, they&#8217;d asked her to come and lend them a hand more out of pity than anything else; and when the three sat down to dinner she said <i>Eh, me! it&#8217;s fine to be young and be married, and maybe he&#8217;ll treat you all right, but mine, my first man, him that&#8217;s now dead, God! he was a fair bull of a man and not only the first night, either. He was aye at it, near deaved me to death he would if he hadn&#8217;t fallen over the edge of a quarry on the road from the feeing-market some nine-ten years come Martinmas.</i> But Mistress Melon said, <i>Havers, are you trying to frighten the lass? She&#8217;ll be fine, her lad&#8217;s both blithe and kind;</i> and Chris loved her for that, she&#8217;d never seemed to see and know Mistress Melon before, thinking her just a hard-working, hard-gossiping old body, now she saw the kindliness of her shine out, her gossiping no more than the dreams she aye dreamt and must tell to others. And then Mistress Melon cried <i>Away and get into your dress now, Chris, before the folk come up.</i></p>

<p>It had left off snowing, Chris, dressing, saw from her window, a sunless day; and a great patching of clouds was upon the sky, the light below bright and sharp, flung by the snow itself; and the smoke rose straight in the air. Far over the braes by Upperhill where Ewan would be getting set in his clothes&#8212;unless he&#8217;d done that long before in the morning&#8212;the sheep were baaing in their winter buchts. Then Chris took off her clothes, and stood white again, and put on the wedding things, mother&#8217;d have like to see them, mother lying dead and forgotten in Kinraddie kirkyard with the twins beside her. She found herself weep then, slowly, hardly, lost and desolate a moment without mother on her marriage-day. And then she shook her head, <i>Oh, don&#8217;t be a fool, do you want to look a fright before Ewan and the folk?</i></p>

<p>She peered at her face in the glass, then, fine! her eyes were bright, the crying had helped them. Pretty in a way, not only good-looking, she saw herself, dour cheek-bones softened for the hour in their chilled bronze setting. And she combed out her hair, it came far past her middle, thick and soft and sweet-smelling and rusty and tarnished gold. Then last was her dress, blue also, but darker than her underclothes because so short was the time since father had died, she threaded the neck with a narrow black ribbon but round her own neck put nothing, her skin was the guerdon there.</p>

<p>So, ready, she turned herself round a minute, and held back the skirt from her ankles and liked them, they were neat and round, she had comely bones, her feet looked long and lithe in the black silk stockings and shoes. She found herself a hanky, last, and sprinkled some scent in that, only a little; and hid it away in her breast and went down the stairs just as she heard the first gig drive up.</p>

<p>That was the Strachans from Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, Mistress Strachan fell long in the face at first. But Chae soon kindled her up with a dram, he whispered to Chris that he&#8217;d look after the drink; and Mistress Melon said it was aye best to have a man body at that end of the stir. And before they could say much more there come a fair stream of traffic up from the turnpike, all Kinraddie seemed on the move to Blawearie: except the old folk from Netherhill, and they sent their kind wishes and two clucking hens for Chris&#8217;s nests.</p>

<p>The hens broke the ice, you might say, for they got themselves loose from the gig of the Netherhill folk and started a wild flutter and chirawk everywhere, anywhere out of Blawearie. Long Rob of the Mill was coming up the road at that minute, in his Sunday best, and he met the first hen and heard the cry-out that followed her, and he cried himself, <i>Shoo, you bitch!</i> The hen dodged into the ditch, but Rob was after her, grabbing her, she squawked fair piercing as he carried her up to the house, his fine Sunday coat was lathered with snow; and he said that such-like work would have been nothing to Chae, who had chased the bit ostriches out in the Transvaal, but he&#8217;d had no training himself. Syne he took up the dram that Chae had poured him and cried <i>Here&#8217;s to the bonniest maid Kircaddie will mind for many a year!</i></p>

<p>That was kind of him, Chris had been cool and quiet enough until then, but she blushed at that, seeing Rob stand like a viking out of the picture books with the iron-grey glint in his eyes. Mistress Munro, though, was right sore jealous as usual, she poked her nose in the air and said, and not over-low, <i>The great fool might wait for the tea before he starts his speechifying;</i> she was maybe mad that nobody had ever said <i>she</i> was bonny; or if anybody ever had, he was an uncommon liar.</p>

<p>Then the Bridge End folk came up, then Ellison and his wife and their daughter, and then the Gordons, and then the minister, riding on his bicycle, it looked as though he&#8217;d had a fall or two and he wasn&#8217;t in the best of temper, he wouldn&#8217;t have a dram, <i>No, thank you, Chae,</i> he said, real stiff-like. And when Rob gave him a sly bit look, <i>You&#8217;ve been communing with Mother Earth, I see, Mr. Gibbon,</i> he just turned his back and made out he didn&#8217;t hear, and folk looked fair uncomfortable, all except Long Rob himself and Chae, they winked one at the other, and then at Chris.</p>

<p>She thought the Minister a fusionless fool, and went to the door to see who else was coming; and there, would you believe it, was poor old Pooty toiling up through the drifts with a great parcel under his oxter, his old face was white with snow and he shivered and hoasted as he came in, peeking out below his old, worn brows for Chris. <i>Where&#8217;s the bit llllass!</i> he cried, and then saw her and put the parcel in her hands, and she opened it then, as the custom was, and in it lay a fine pair of shoes he had made for her, shoes of glistening leather with gay green soles, and a pair of slippers, soft-lined with wool, there wouldn&#8217;t be a grander pair in Kinraddie. And she said <i>Oh, thank you,</i> and she knew that wasn&#8217;t enough, he stood peering up at her like an old hen peers, she didn&#8217;t know why she did it but she put her arms round him and kissed him, folk laughed at that, all but the two of them, Pooty blinked and stuttered till Long Rob reached out a hand and pulled him into a chair and cried <i>Wet your whistle with this, Pooty man, you&#8217;ve hardly a minute ere the wedding begins.</i></p>

<p>And he was right, for up the road came walking the last two, Ewan and his best man, the Highlander McIvor, near six feet six, red-headed, red-faced, a red Highlandman that bowed so low to Chris that she felt a fool; and presented his present, and it was a ram&#8217;s horn shod with silver, real bonny and unco, like all Highland things. But Ewan took never a look at Chris, they made out they didn&#8217;t see one the other, and Mistress Melon whispered to her to go tidy her hair, and when she came down again all the place was quiet, there was hardly a murmur. She stopped at the foot of the stairs with the heart beating so against her skin it was like to burst from her breast; and there was Chae Strachan waiting her, he held out his arm and patted her hand, when she laid it on his arm, and he whispered <i>Ready then, Chris?</i></p>

<p>Then he opened the parlour door, the place was crowded, there were all the folk sitting in chairs, solemn as a kirk congregation, and over by the window stood the Reverend Gibbon, very stern and more like a curly bull than ever; and in front of him waited Ewan and his best man, McIvor. Chris had for bridesmaids the little Ellison girl and Maggie Jean Gordon, they joined with her, she couldn&#8217;t see clear for a minute then, or maybe too clear, she didn&#8217;t seem to be seeing with her own eyes at all. And then Chae had loosed her hand from his arm and she and Ewan stood side by side, he was wearing a new suit, tweed it was, and smelt lovely, his dark face was solemn and frightened and white, he stood close to her, she knew him more frightened than she was herself. Something of her own fear went from her then, she stood listening to the Reverend Gibbon and the words he was reading, words that she&#8217;d never heard before, this was the first marriage she&#8217;d ever been at.</p>

<p>And then she heard Chae whisper behind her and listened more carefully still, and heard Ewan say <i>I will,</i> in a desperate kind of voice, and then said it herself, her voice was as happy and clear as well you&#8217;d have wished, she smiled up at Ewan, the white went from his face and the red came in spate. The Red Highlander behind slipped something forward, she saw it was the ring, and then Ewan fitted it over her finger, his fingers were hot and unsteady, and Mr. Gibbon closed his eyes and said, <i>Let us pray.</i></p>

<p>And Chris held on to Ewan&#8217;s hand and bent her head and listened to him, the minister; and he asked God to bless their union, to give them courage and strength for the difficulties that the years might bring to them, to make fruitful their marriage and their love as pure and enduring in its fulfilment as in its conception. They were lovely words, words like the marching of a bronze-leafed beech on the lips of a summer sky. So Chris thought, her head down-bent and her hand in Ewan&#8217;s, then she lost the thread that the words were strung on, because of that hand of Ewan&#8217;s that still held hers; and she curbed her little finger into his palm, it was hard and rough there and she tickled the skin secretly, and his hand quivered and she took the littlest keep at his face. There was that smile of his, fliting like a startled cat; and then his hand closed firm and warm and sure on hers, and hers lay quiet in his, and the minister had finished and was shaking their hands.</p>

<p>He hesitated a minute and then bent to kiss Chris; close to hers she saw his face older far than when he came to Kinraddie, there were pouches under his eyes, and a weary look in his eyes, and his kiss she didn&#8217;t like. Ewan&#8217;s was a peck, but Chae&#8217;s was fine, it was hearty and kind though he reeked of the awful tobacco he smoked, and then Long Rob&#8217;s, it was clean and sweet and dry, like a whiff from the Mill itself; and then it seemed every soul in Kinraddie was kissing her, except only Tony, the daftie, he&#8217;d been left at home. Everybody was speaking and laughing and slapping Ewan on the back and coming to kiss her, those that knew her well and some that didn&#8217;t. And last it was Mistress Melon, her eyes were over bright but careful still, she nearly smothered Chris and then whispered <i>Up to your room and tidy yourself, they&#8217;ve messed your hair.</i></p>

<p>She escaped them then, the folk trooped out to the kitchen where the fire was roaring, Chae passed round the drams again, there was port for the women if they wanted it and raspberry drinks for the children. Soon&#8217;s the parlour was clear Mistress Melon and Mistress Garthmore had the chairs whisked aside, the tables put forward and the cloths spread; and there came a loud tinkling as they spread the supper, barely past three though it was. But Chris knew it fell likely that few had eaten much at their dinners in Kinraddie that day, there wouldn&#8217;t have been much sense with a marriage in prospect: and as soon as they&#8217;d something solid in their bellies to foundation the drink, as a man might say, the better it would be.</p>

<p>In her room that wouldn&#8217;t be her room for long Chris brushed her hair and settled her dress and looked at her flushed, fair face, it was nearly the same, hard to believe though you thought it. And then something felt queer about her, the ring on her hand it was, she stood and stared at the thing till a soft whispering drew her eyes to the window, the snow had come on again, a scurry and a blinding drive from down the hills; and below in the house they were crying <i>The bride, where is she?</i></p>

<p>So down she went, folk had trooped back in the parlour by then and were sitting them round the tables, the minister at the head of one, Long Rob at the head of another, in the centre one the wedding cake stood tall on its stand with the Highland dirk beside it that Ewan had gotten from McIvor to do the cutting. The wind had risen storming without as Chris stood to cut, there in her blue frock with the long, loose sleeves, there came a great whoom in the chimney and some looked out at the window and said that the drifts would be a fell feet deep by the morn. And then the cake was cut and Chris sat down, Ewan beside her, and found she wasn&#8217;t hungry at all, about the only soul in the place that wasn&#8217;t, everybody else was taking a fair hearty meal.</p>

<p>The minister had thawed away by then, he was laughing real friendly-like in his bull-like boom of a voice, telling of other weddings he&#8217;d made in his time, they&#8217;d all been gey funny and queer-like weddings, things that you laughed at, not fine like this. And Chris listened and glowed with pride that everything at hers was just and right; and then again as so often that qualm of doubt came down on her, separating her away from these kindly folk of the farms&#8212;kind, and aye ready to believe the worst of others they heard, unbelieving that others could think the same of themselves. So maybe the minister no more than buttered her, she looked at him with the dark, cool doubt in her face, next instant forgot him in a glow of remembrance that blinded all else: she was married to Ewan.</p>

<p>Beside her: he whispered <i>Oh, eat something, Chris, you&#8217;ll fair go famished,</i> and she tried some ham and a bit of the dumpling, sugared and fine, that Mistress Melon had made. And everybody praised it, as well they might, and cried for more helpings, and more cups of tea, and there were scones and pancakes and soda-cakes and cakes made with honey that everybody ate; and little Wat Strachan stopped eating of a sudden and cried

<i>Mother, I&#8217;m not right in the belly!</i> everybody laughed at that but Kirsty, she jumped to her feet and hurried him out, and came back with him with his face real frightened. But faith! It didn&#8217;t put a stop to the bairn, he started in again as hungry as ever, and Chae cried out <i>Well, well, let him be, maybe it tasted as fine coming up as it did going down!</i></p>

<p>Some laughed at that, others reddened and looked real affronted, Chris herself didn&#8217;t care. Cuddiestoun and his wife sat opposite her, it was like watching a meikle collie and a futret at meat, him gulping down everything that came his way and a lot that didn&#8217;t, he would rax for that; and his ugly face, poor stock, fair shone and glimmered with the exercise. But Mistress Munro snapped down at her plate with sharp, quick teeth, her head never still a minute, just like a futret with a dog nearby. They were saying hardly anything, so busied they were, but Ellison next to them had plenty to say, he&#8217;d taken a dram over much already and was crying things across the table to Chris, Mistress Tavendale he called her at every turn; and he said that she and Mistress Ellison must get better acquaint. Maybe he&#8217;d regret that the morn, if he minded his promise: and that wasn&#8217;t likely.</p>

<p>Next to him was Kirsty and the boys and next to that the minister&#8217;s table with Alec Mutch and his folk and young Gordon; a real minister&#8217;s man was Alec, awful chief-like the two of them were, but Mistress Mutch sat lazy as ever, now and then she cast a bit look at Chris out of the lazy, gley eyes of her, maybe there was a funniness in the look that hadn&#8217;t to do with the squint.</p>

<p>Up at Rob&#8217;s table an argument rose, Chris hoped that it wasn&#8217;t religion, she saw Mr. Gordon&#8217;s wee face pecked up to counter Rob. But Rob was just saying what a shame it was that folk should be shamed nowadays to speak Scotch&#8212;or they called it Scots if they did, the split-tongued sourocks! Every damned little narrow dowped rat that you met put on the English if he thought he&#8217;d impress you&#8212;as though Scotch wasn&#8217;t good enough now, it had words in it that the thin bit scrachs of the English could never come at. And Rob said <i>You can tell me, man, what&#8217;s the English for sotter, or greip, or smore, or pleiter, gloaming or glanching or well-henspeckled? And if you said gloaming was sunset you&#8217;d fair be a liar; and you&#8217;re hardly that, Mr. Gordon.</i></p>

<p>But Gordon was real decent and reasonable, <i>You can&#8217;t help it, Rob. If folk are to get on in the world nowadays, away from the ploughshafts and out of the pleiter, they must use the English, orra though it be.</i> And Chae cried out that was right enough, and God! who could you blame? And a fair bit breeze got up about it all, every soul in the parlour seemed speaking at once; and as aye when they spoke of the thing they agreed that the land was a coarse, coarse life, you&#8217;d do better at almost anything else, folks that could send their lads to learn a trade were right wise, no doubt of that, there was nothing on the land but work, work, work, and chave, chave, chave, from the blink of day till the fall of night, no thanks from the soss and sotter, and hardly a living to be made.</p>

<p>Syne Cuddiestoun said that he&#8217;d heard of a childe up Laurencekirk way, a banker&#8217;s son from the town he was, and he&#8217;d come to do farming in a scientific way. So he&#8217;d said at first, had the childe, but God! by now you could hardly get into the place for the clutter of machines that lay in the yard; and <i>he</i> wouldn&#8217;t store the kiln long. But Chae wouldn&#8217;t have that, he swore <i>Damn&#8217;t, no, the machine&#8217;s the best friend of man, or it would be so in a socialist state. It&#8217;s coming and the chaving&#8217;ll end, you&#8217;ll see, the machine&#8217;ll do all the dirty work.</i> And Long Rob called out that he&#8217;d like right well to see the damned machine that would muck you a pigsty even though they all turned socialist to-morrow. And they all took a bit laugh at that, Chris and Ewan were fair forgotten for a while, they looked at each other and smiled, Ewan reached down and squeezed her hand and Chris wished every soul but themselves a hundred miles from Blawearie.</p>

<p>But then Chae cried <i>Fill up your glasses, folk, the best man has a toast.</i> And the red Highlander, McIvor, got up to his feet and bowed his red head to Chris, and began to speak; he spoke fine, though funny with that Highland twist, he said he&#8217;d never seen a sweeter quean than the bride or known a better friend than the groom; and he wished them long and lovely days, a marriage in the winter had the best of it. For was not the Spring to come and the seed-time springing of their love, and the bonny days of the summer, flowering it, and autumn with the harvest of their days? And when they passed to that other winter together they would know that was not the end of it, it was but a sleep that in another life would burgeon fresh from another earth. He could never believe but that two so young and fair as his friend and his friend&#8217;s wife, once made one flesh would be one in the spirit as well; and have their days built of happiness and their nights of the music of the stars.</p>

<p>And he lifted his glass and cried <i>The bride!</i> looking at Chris with his queer bright eyes, the daft Highland poet, they were all like that, the red Highlanders. And everybody cried

<i>Good luck to her!</i> and they all drank up and Chris felt herself blush from head to foot under all the blue things she wore.</p>

<p>And then Long Rob of the Mill was making a speech, different from McIvor&#8217;s as well it might be. He said he&#8217;d never married himself because he&#8217;d over-much respect for those kittle folk, women; but if he&#8217;d been ten years younger he was damned if his respect would have kept him from having a try for Chris Guthrie, and beating that Highland childe, Ewan, at his own fell game. That was just Ewan&#8217;s luck, he thought, not his judgment, and Chris was clean thrown away on her husband, as she&#8217;d have been on any husband at all: but himself. Ah well, no doubt she&#8217;d train him up well, and he advised Ewan now, from the little that he knew of marriage, never to counter his wife; not that he thought she wasn&#8217;t well able to look after herself, but just that Ewan mightn&#8217;t find himself worsted though he thought himself winner.</p>

<p>Marriage, he took it, was like yoking together two two-year-olds, they were kittle and brisk on the first bit rig&#8212;unless they&#8217;d fallen out as soon as they were yoked and near kicked themselves and their harness to bits&#8212;but the second rig was the testing time, it was then you knew when one was pulling and one held back, the one that hard sheer sweirty&#8212;and that was a word for Mr. Gordon to put into English&#8212;in its bones, and the one with a stout bit heart and a good guts. Well, he wouldn&#8217;t say more about horses, though faith! it was a fascinating topic, he&#8217;d just come back to marriage and say they all wished the best to Chris, so sweet and trig, and to Ewan, the Highland cateran, and long might they live and grow healthy, wealthy, and well content.</p>

<p>Then they all drank up again, and God knows who mightn&#8217;t have made the next speech if Chae then hadn&#8217;t stood up and cried <i>The night&#8217;s near on us. Who&#8217;s game for a daylight dance at Chris&#8217;s wedding?</i></p>

<p>So out they all went to the kitchen, it was cold enough there from the heat of the room, but nothing to the cold rife air of the barn when the first of them had crossed the close and stood in the door. But Mistress Melon had kindled a brazier with coal, it crackled fine, well away from the straw, Rob tuned up his fiddle, Chae squeaked on his melodeon, it began to feel brisk and warm even while you stood and near shivered your sark off. Chris was there with the men, of course, and the children and Mistress Gordon and Mistress Mutch and Mistress Strachan were there, Mistress Munro had stayed behind to help clear the tables, she said, and some whispered it was more than likely she&#8217;d clear most of the clearings down her own throat, by God she couldn&#8217;t have eaten a mouthful since Candlemas.</p>

<p>But then Chae cried <i>Strip the Willow,</i> and they all lined up, and the melodeon played bonnily in Chae&#8217;s hands, and Long Rob&#8217;s fiddle-bow was darting and glimmering, and in two minutes in the whirl and go of <i>Strip the Willow,</i> there wasn&#8217;t a cold soul in Blawearie barn, or a cold sole either. Then here, soon&#8217;s they&#8217;d finished, was Mistress Melon with a great jar of hot toddy to drink, she set it on a bench between Chae and Long Rob. And whoever wanted to drink had just to go there, few were bashful in the going, too; and another dance started, it was a schottische, and Chris found herself in the arms of the minister, he could dance like a daft young lad. And as he swung her round and around he opened his mouth and cried <i>Hooch!</i> and so did the red Highlander, McIvor, <i>Hooch!</i> careering by with fat Kirsty Strachan, real scared-like she looked, clipped round the waist.</p>

<p>Then Chae and Long Rob hardly gave them a breather, they were at it dance on dance; and every time they stopped for a panting second Chae would dip in the jar and give Rob a wink and cry <i>Here&#8217;s to you, man!</i> and Rob would dip, solemn-like as well, and say <i>Same to you!</i> and off the fiddle and melodeon would go again, faster than ever. Ewan danced the schottische with prim Mistress Gordon, but for waltzing he found a quean from the Mains, a red-faced, daft-like limmer, she screamed with excitement and everybody laughed, Chris laughed as well. Some were watching to see if she did, she knew, and she heard a whisper she&#8217;d have all her work cut out looking after him, coarse among the queans he was, Ewan Tavendale. But she didn&#8217;t care, she knew it a lie, Ewan was hers and hers only; but she wished he would dance with her for a change.</p>

<p>And here at the <i>Petronella</i> he was, he anyway hadn&#8217;t been drinking, in the noise of the dance as they swayed up and down the barn he whispered <i>Well, Chris?</i> and she whispered back <i>Fine,</i> and he said <i>You&#8217;re the bonniest thing ever seen in Kinraddie, Long Rob was right.</i> And she said she liked him to think so, and he called her back in the darkness away from the dancers, and kissed her quickly and slowly, she didn&#8217;t hurry either, it was blithe and glad to stand there kissing, each strained to hear when they&#8217;d be discovered.</p>

<p>And then they were, Chae crying <i>Where&#8217;s the bride and the groom? Damn&#8217;t it, they&#8217;re lost!</i> and out they&#8217;d to come. Chae cried was there anyone else could play the melodeon? and young Jock Gordon cried back to him <i>Ay, fine that,</i> and came stitering across the floor and sat himself down by the toddy jar, and played loud and clear and fine.</p>

<p>Then Chae caught Chris, he said to Ewan <i>Away, you greedy brute, wait a while till she&#8217;s yours forever and aye,</i> and he danced right neatly, you didn&#8217;t expect it from Chae, with his grey eyes laughing down at you. And as he danced he said suddenly, grave like, <i>Never doubt your Ewan, Chris, or never let him know that you do. That&#8217;s the hell of a married life. Praise him up and tell him he&#8217;s fine, that there&#8217;s not a soul in the Howe can stand beside him, and he&#8217;ll want to cuddle you till the day he dies; and he&#8217;ll blush at the sight of you fifty years on as much as he does the day.</i> She said <i>I&#8217;ll try,</i> and

<i>Thank you, Chae,</i> and he said <i>Och, it must be the whisky speaking,</i> and surrendered her up to Ellison, and took the melodeon from Gordon again, but staggered and leant back against the sack that hung as a draught-shield behind the musician&#8217;s place. Down came the sack and there among the hay was the minister and the maid from the Mains that had scraiched so loud, she&#8217;d her arms round him and the big curly bull was kissing the quean like a dog lapping up its porridge.</p>

<p>Chris&#8217;s heart near stopped, but Chae snatched up the sack, hooked it back on its hook again, nobody saw the sight except himself and Chris and maybe Long Rob. But you couldn&#8217;t be sure about Rob, he looked as solemn as five owls all in one, and was playing as though, said Chae, he was paid by piece-work and not by time.</p>

<p>Between eight and nine Mistress Melon came out to the barn and cried them to supper, the storm had left off, all but a flake that sailed down now and then like a sailing gull in the beam from the barn door. On the ground the snow crinkled under their feet, frost had set in, the folk stood and breathed in the open air, and laughed, and cried one to the other, <i>Man, I&#8217;ll have aching joints the morn!</i> The women ran first to the house, to tidy their hair, Ewan saw everybody in, except Munro of the Cuddiestoun, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>And then Ewan heard a funny bit breathing as he passed by the stable; and he stopped and opened the door and struck a match, and there was Munro, all in his Sunday-best, lying in the stall beside Clyde the horse, and his arms were round the beast&#8217;s neck, and faith! the beast looked real disgusted. Ewan shook him and cried <i>Munro, you can&#8217;t sleep here,</i> but Munro just blinked the eyes in his face, daft-like, and grumbled <i>Why not?</i> Syne Alec Mutch turned back from the house to see what all the stir was about, and both he and Ewan had another go at the prostrate Munro, but damn the move would he make, Alec cried <i>To hell with him, leave him there with the mare, she&#8217;s maybe a damned sight kinder a bed-mate then ever was that futret of a wife of his.</i></p>

<p>So they closed the door of the stable and went into their supper, everybody ate near as well as at tea-time, fair starved they were with the dancing and drink. Chris had thought she herself was tired till she ate some supper, and then she felt as fresh ever, and backed up Long Rob, who looked twice as sober as any of the men and had drunk about twice as much as any three of them, when he cried <i>Who&#8217;s for a dance again?</i> Mistress Melon had the toddy-jar filled fresh full and they carried that out, everybody came to the barn this time except Mistress Munro, <i>No, no, I&#8217;ll clear the table.</i></p>

<p>And young Elsie Ellison, wondering for why the creature should stay behind, stayed herself and took a bit keek round the corner of the door: and there was Mistress Munro, with a paper bag in her hand, stuffing it with scones and biscuits and cake, and twisting her head this side and that, like the head of a futret. So Elsie, fair scared, ran off to the barn and caught at her father&#8217;s tails and cried <i>The Cuddiestoun wife&#8217;s away home with the pieces,</i> and Ellison, he was whisked up to high tune by then, cried <i>Let her run to hell and be damned to her.</i></p>

<p>Syne he started a tale about how once she insulted him, the dirty Scotch bitch. But Long Rob and Chae were striking up a dance again and Chris heard no more of the Ellison story, dancing a waltz with young Jock Gordon, it was like flying, Jock&#8217;s face was white with excitement. The fourth dance Alec Mutch, the fool, began to stiter the floor, backwards and forwards, he was a real nuisance till he passed Long Rob and then Rob cried <i>Hoots, Alec, man, your feet are all wrong!</i> and thrust out a foot among Alec&#8217;s and couped him down and Chae shoved him aside to the straw with a foot and a hand, and played on with the other foot and hand, or maybe with a foot and his teeth, a skilly man, Chae.</p>

<p>Mistress Mutch said nothing, just standing and laughing and smoking at her cigarette. There were more men than women in the barn, though, even when the men made do with a little quean, and soon Chris found herself dancing with Mistress Mutch, the great, easy-going slummock, she spoke slow and easy as though she&#8217;d just wakened up from her sleep. Chris couldn&#8217;t tell what way she looked with that gleying eye, but what she spoke was <i>Take things easy in married life, Chris, but not over-easy, that&#8217;s been MY ruin. Though God knows it&#8217;ll make not a difference in a hundred years&#8217; time and we&#8217;re dead. Don&#8217;t let Ewan saddle you with a birn full of bairns, Chris, it kills you and eats your heart away, forbye the unease and the dirt of it. Don&#8217;t let him, Chris, they&#8217;re all the same, men; and you won&#8217;t well steer clear of the first or the second. But you belong to yourself, mind that.</i></p>

<p>Chris went hot and cold and then wanted to ask something of Mistress Mutch and looked at her and found she couldn&#8217;t, she&#8217;d just have to find the thing out for herself. Long Rob came down to dance with her next, he&#8217;d left the fiddle to old Gordon, and he asked what that meikle slummock had been saying to her? And Chris said <i>Oh, just stite,</i> and Rob said <i>Mind, don&#8217;t let any of those damned women fear you, Chris; it&#8217;s been the curse of the human race, listening to advice.</i> And Chris said <i>But I&#8217;m listening to yours, Rob, now, amn&#8217;t I?</i> He nodded to her, solemn, and said, <i>Oh, you&#8217;ve your head screwed on and you&#8217;ll manage fine. But mind, if there&#8217;s ever a thing you want with a friend, not to speak it abroad all over Kinraddie, I&#8217;ll aye be there at the Mill to help you.</i> Chris thought that a daft-like speak for Rob, kind maybe he meant it, but she&#8217;d have Ewan, who else could she want?</p>

<p>And then the fun slackened off, the barn was warm, folk sat or lay on the benches or straw, Chris looked round and saw nothing of the minister then, maybe he&#8217;d gone. She whispered to Chae about that, but he said <i>Damn the fears, he&#8217;s out to be sick, can&#8217;t you hear him like a cat with a fish-bone in its throat?</i> And hear him they could, but Chris had been right after all, he didn&#8217;t come back. Maybe he was shamed and maybe he just lost his way, for next noon there were folk who swore they&#8217;d seen the marks of great feet that walked round and round in a circle, circle after circle, all across the parks from Blawearie to the Manse; and if these weren&#8217;t the minister&#8217;s feet they must have been the devil&#8217;s, you could choose whichever you liked.</p>

<p>No sooner was the dancing done than there were cries <i>Rob, what about a song now, man?</i> And Rob said <i>Och, ay, I&#8217;ll manage that fine,</i> and he off with his coat and loosened his collar and sang them <i>Ladies of Spain;</i> and then he turned round to where Chris stood beside her Ewan and sang <i>The Lass that Made the Bed to Me:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>Her hair was like the link o&#8217; gowd,<br>
  Her teeth were like the ivorie,<br>
Her cheeks like lilies dipt in wine,<br>
  The lass that made the bed to me.<br>
<br>
Her bosom was the driven snaw,<br>
  Two drifted heaps sae fair to see,<br>

Her limbs, the polished marble stane,<br>
  The lass that made the bed to me.<br>
<br>
I kissed her owre and owre again,<br>
  And aye she wist na what to say,<br>
I laid her between me and the wa&#8217;,<br>
  The lassie thought na long till day.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Folk stared and nodded at Chris while Rob was singing and Ewan looked at first as though he&#8217;d like to brain him; and then he blushed; but Chris just listened and didn&#8217;t care, she thought the song fine and the lass lovely, she hoped she herself would seem as lovely this night&#8212;or as much of it as their dancing would leave. So she clapped Rob and syne it was Ellison&#8217;s turn, he stood up with his meikle belly a-wag and sang them a song they didn&#8217;t know:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Roses and lilies her cheeks disclose,<br>
  But her red lips are sweeter than those,<br>
Kiss her, caress her,<br>
  With blisses her kisses,<br>
Dissolve us in pleasure and soft repose.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and then another, an English one and awful sad, about a young childe called Villikins and a quean called Dinah, and it finished:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>For a cup of cold pizen lay there on the
ground</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>With a tooril-i-ooril-i-oorily-i-ay.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chae cried that was hardly the kind of thing that they wanted, woeful as that; and they&#8217;d better give Chris a rest about her roses an lips and limbs, she had them all in safe-keeping and would know how to use them; and what about a seasonable song? And he sang so that all joined in seasonable enough, for the snow had come on again in spite of the frost:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Up in the morning&#8217;s no for me,<br>
  Up in the morning early,<br>
When a&#8217; the hills are covered wi&#8217; snaw<br>

  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s winter fairly!</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then Mistress Mutch sang, that was hardly expected, and folk tittered a bit; but she had as good a voice as most and better than some, she sang <i>The Bonnie House o&#8217; Airlie,</i> and then the <i>Auld Robin Grey</i> that eye brought Chris near to weeping, and did now, and not her alone, with Rob&#8217;s fiddle whispering it out, the sadness and the soreness of it, though it was long, long syne:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>When the sheep are in the fauld, and the kye are a&#8217;
at hame<br>
And a&#8217; the weary world to its rest has gane,<br>

The tears o&#8217; my sorrow fa&#8217; in shooers frae my e&#8217;e<br>
And Auld Robin Gray he lies sound by me.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and all the tale of young Jamie who went to sea and was thought to be drownded in an awful storm; and his lass married Auld Robin Gray, and syne Jamie came back but couldn&#8217;t win his lass away from the auld man, though near brokenhearted she was:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>I gang like a ghaist, and I carena&#8217; to spin,<br>
I daurna&#8217; think o&#8217; Jamie, for that wad be a sin,<br>
But I&#8217;ll try aye my best a guid wife to be,<br>
For Auld Robin Gray he is kind to me.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old Pooty was sleeping in a corner; he woke up then, fell keen to recite his TIMROUS BEASTIE; but they pulled him down and cried on the bride herself for a song. And all she could think of was that south country woman crying in the night by the side of her good man, the world asleep and grey without; and she whispered the song to Rob and he tuned his fiddle and she sang, facing them, young and earnest, and she saw Ewan looking at her solemn and proud, <i>The Flowers of the Forest:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;ve heard them lilting at our ewe-milking,<br>
  Lasses a&#8217; lilting before dawn o&#8217; day;<br>
But now they are moaning on ilka green loaning,<br>
  The Flooers o&#8217; the Forest are a&#8217; wede away.<br>
<br>
Dool and wae for the order sent oor lads tae the Border!<br>

  The English for ance, by guile wan the day,<br>
The Flooers o&#8217; the Forest, that fought aye the foremost,<br>
  The pride o&#8217; oor land lie cauld in the clay.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chae jumped up when she finished, he said <i>Damn&#8217;t, folk, we&#8217;ll all have the whimsies if we listen to any more woesome songs! Have none of you a cheerful one?</i> And the folk in the barn laughed at him and shook their heads, it came on Chris how strange was the sadness of Scotland&#8217;s singing, made for the sadness of the land and sky in dark autumn evenings, the crying of men and women of the land who had seen their lives and loves sink away in the years, things wept for beside the sheep-ouchts, remembered at night and in twilight. The gladness and kindness had passed, lived and forgotten, it was Scotland of the mist and rain and the crying sea that made the songs&#8212;And Chae cried <i>Let&#8217;s have another dance, then, it&#8217;s nearly a quarter to twelve, we must all be off soon as midnight chaps.</i></p>

<p>And they all minded what midnight would bring, and Chae and Rob had the melodeon and fiddle in hand again, and struck up an eightsome, and everybody grabbed him a partner, it didn&#8217;t matter who was who, McIvor had Chris and danced with her as though he would like to squeeze her to death, he danced light as thistle-down, the great red Highlander; and no sooner was one dance finished than Rob and Chae swept forward into another, they played like mad and the lights whipped and jumped as the couples spun round and round; and the music went out across the snowing night; and then Chae pulled out his great silver watch, and laid it beside him, playing on.</p>

<p>And suddenly it was the New Year, the dancing stopped and folk all shook hands, coming to shake Chris&#8217;s and Ewan&#8217;s; and Long Rob struck up the sugary surge of <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> and they all joined hands and stood in a circle to sing it, and Chris thought of Will far over the seas in Argentine, under the hot night there. Then the singing finished, they all found themselves tired, somebody began to take down the barn lights, there was half an hour&#8217;s scramble of folk getting themselves into coats and getting their shivering sholts from out the empty stalls in the byre. Then Chris and Ewan were handshook again, Chris&#8217;s arm began to ache, and then the last woof-woof of wheels on snow thick-carpeted came up the Blawearie road to them, it was fell uncanny that silence in the place after all the noise and fun of the long, lit hours. And there was Mistress Melon in the kitchen-door, yawning fit to swallow a horse, she whispered to Chris <i>I&#8217;m taking your room now, don&#8217;t forget,</i> and cried them <i>Good night, and a sound sleep, both!</i> and was up the stairs and left them alone.</p>

<p>He hardly seemed tired even then, though, Ewan, prowling locking the doors like a great quiet cat till Chris called to him softly <i>Oh, sit by me!</i> So he came to the chair she sat in and picked her out of it, so strong he was, and himself sat down, still holding her. They watched the fire a long time and then Chris&#8217;s head dropped down, she didn&#8217;t know she had been asleep till she woke to find Ewan shaking her, <i>Chris, Chris, you&#8217;re fair done, come on to bed.</i> The fire was dying then and the paraffin had run low in the lamp, the flame swithered and went out with a plop! as Ewan blew on it; and then they were in the dark, going up the stairs together, past the room that had been Chris&#8217;s and where Mistress Melon slept for a night ere she went back to Stonehaven.</p>

<p>And to Chris going up that stair holding the hand of her man there came a memory of one with awful eyes and jutting beard, lying in that room they came to, lying there and whispering and cursing her. But she put the memory away, it had never happened, sad and daft to remember that, she was tired. Then, with her hand on the door, Ewan kissed her there in the dark, sweet and wild his kiss, she had not thought he could kiss her like that, not as though he wanted her as a man might do in that hour and place, but as though he minded the song he had heard her sing. She put up her face to the kiss, forgetting tiredness, suddenly she was wakeful as never she had been, the sleep went out of her head and body and the chill with it, Ewan&#8217;s hand came over hers and opened the door.</p>

<p>A fire burned bright in the fireplace, they had thought the place would be black and cold, but Mistress Melon had seen to that. And there was the bridal bed, pulled out from the wall, all in white it was, with sheet and blanket turned back, the window curtains were drawn, and in the moment they stood breathing from their climb of the stairs Chris heard the sound of the snow that stroked the window, with quiet, soft fingers, as though writing there.</p>

<p>Then she forgot it, standing by the fire getting out of her blue things, one by one. She found it sweet to do that, so slowly, and to have Ewan kiss her at last when there was no bar to his kisses, lying with him then, with the light put out and the radiance of the fire on the walls and ceiling. And she turned towards him at last, whispering and tender for him, <i>We&#8217;re daft, we&#8217;ll catch cold without anything on!</i> and then she saw his face beside her, solemn and strange, yet not strange at all. And he put his left hand below her neck, and he took her close to him, and they were one flesh, one and together; and far into the morning she woke, and was not cold at all, him holding her so, and then she heard again the hand of winter write on the window, and listened a moment, happy, happy, and fell fast asleep till morning brought Mistress Melon and two great cups of tea to waken Ewan and herself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that was her marriage, not like wakening from a dream was marrying, but like going into one, rather, she wasn&#8217;t sure, not for days, what things they had dreamt and what actually done&#8212;she and this farmer of Blawearie who would stir of a morning at the jangle of the clock and creep from bed, the great cat, and be down the stairs to light the fire and put on the kettle. She&#8217;d never be far behind him, though, she loved even the bitterness of those frozen mornings, and a bitter winter it was, every crack and joint of the old house played a spray of cold wind across the rooms. He&#8217;d be gone to the byre and stable as she came down and sought out the porridge meal and put it to boil, Blawearie&#8217;s own meal, fine rounded stuff that Ewan so liked. She&#8217;d leave it to hotter there on the fire and then bring the pails from the dairy and open the kitchen door on the close and gasp in the bite of the wind, seeing a grey world on the edge of morning, the bare stubble of the ley riding quick on the close, peering between the shapes of the stacks, the lights of the lanterns shining in byre and stable and barn as Ewan feeded and mucked and tended horses and kye.</p>

<p>And the byre would hang heavy with the breaths of the kye, they&#8217;d have finished their turnips as she came in, and Ewan would come swinging after her with a great armful of straw to spread them in front, he&#8217;d tickle her neck as she sat to milk and she&#8217;d cry <i>Your hand&#8217;s freezing!</i> and he&#8217;d say <i>Away, woman, you&#8217;re still asleep. Up in the morning&#8217;s the thing!</i> and go whistling out to the stable, Clyde and Bess stamping there, getting fell cornfilled and frolicsome, they more than wanted exercise. She would carry the milk back herself most mornings and make the breakfast, but sometimes Ewan would come with her, so young and daft they were, folk would have laughed to see them at that, both making breakfast and sitting them close to eat it.</p>

<p>Then Ewan would light his pipe when he&#8217;d done and sit and smoke while she finished more slowly; and then he&#8217;d say that he&#8217;d meat the hens, and she&#8217;d tell him not to haver, she&#8217;d do that herself, and he&#8217;d argue, maybe sulk, till she kissed him back to his senses again. Then he&#8217;d laugh and get up and get down John Guthrie&#8217;s gun, and be out and up in the moors till eleven, sometimes he&#8217;d bring a great bag and Chris would sell the spare rabbits to the grocer that came on Tuesdays.</p>

<p>There was little to be done, such weather on Blawearie. Ewan tidied the barn they&#8217;d danced in, it seemed years ago since that night, and got ready plough and sock and coulter for the time when the weather would break. And then he found the bruised corn running low in the great kist there, that was his first out-going from the place since his marriage, Chris watched him go, sitting in the front of the box-cart, Clyde in the shafts, the cart loaded down with corn for the Mill, and Ewan turning to wave to her from the foot of Blawearie brae. And all that afternoon he was away she fretted from room to room, oh! she was a fool, there was nothing could happen to him! And when at last he came back she ran out to him, fair scared he was at the way she looked, and thought her ill, and when she cried she had missed him so he went white and then blushed, just a boy still, and forgot to unyoke Clyde left in the cold, he was kissing Chris instead. And faith! for the bairns of farmers both they might well have had more sense.</p>

<p>But, and it crept into her mind that night and came often in the morning and days that followed, somehow that going of Ewan&#8217;s to the Mill had ended the foolishness that shut them in fast from Kinraddie and all the world, they two alone, with all the gladness that was theirs alone and her kisses the most that Ewan&#8217;d ever seek and his kisses ending days and nights, and almost life itself for her. Kinraddie came in again, something of her own cool reliance came back, the winter wore on to its close, and mid-February brought the sun, weather that might well have come out of a May.</p>

<p>Looking out from her window as every morning still she did, Chris saw the steam of the lands below the house, it was as though the earth had swung round the fields of Kinraddie into the maw of the sun, a great furnace, and left them there to dry. The hills marched their great banners of steam into the face of each sunrise and through the whisper and wakening and shrouding of the morning came presently the moan of the foghorn at Todhead, a dreadful bellow, like a sore-sick calf, it went on and on, long after the mist had cleared, it rose and faded into the sun-dazzle overhead as great clouds of gulls came wheeling in from the sea. They knew what was toward on Kinraddie&#8217;s land, Chris heard the call of them as she went about the day&#8217;s work, and looked out on the ley field then, there was Ewan with the horses, ploughing his first rig, bent over the shafts, one foot in the drill, one the rig side, the ploughshare, sharp and crude and new, cleaving the red-black clay. The earth wound back like a ribbon and curved and lay; and the cloud of gulls cawed and screamed and pecked on the rig and followed at Ewan&#8217;s heels again.</p>

<p>All over Kinraddie there were horse-pairs out, though none so early as Ewan&#8217;s, it seemed, folk had stayed undecided about the weather, they&#8217;d other things to do, they&#8217;d say, than just wait about to show off like that young Blawearie. But, when the day rose and at nine Chris set her a jug of tea in a basket, and set by it scones well buttered and jammed, and carried out the basket to Ewan <i>wishing</i> up the face of the rig, Chae Strachan, far away and below, was a-bend above his plough-shafts at the tail of his team, Upperhill had two pairs in the great park that loitered up to the larch-wood, and there was Cuddiestoun&#8217;s pair, you guessed it him and his horses, though they never came full in sight, their heads and backs just skimmed the verge of the wood and hill.</p>

<p>Spring had come and was singing and rilling all over the fields, you listened and heard, it was like listening to the land new wake, to the burst and flow of a dozen burns in this ditch and that; and when you turned out the cattle for their first spring dander, in case they went off the legs, they near went off the face of the earth instead, daft and delighted, they ran and scampered and slid, Chris was feared that the kye would break their legs. She tried driving them down to the old hayfield, but the steers broke loose and held down the road, and Ewan saw them and left his plough and chased them across the parks, swearing blue murder at them as he ran; and faith! if it hadn&#8217;t been for the postman meeting them and turning them at the end of the road they might well have been running still.</p>

<p>Chris had known then mazes of things to do in that bright coming of the weather, the house was all wrong, it was foul and feckless, Ewan unyoking at midday would come in and make hardly his way through the kitchen, heaped high with the gear of some room, Chris saw her long hands grow sore and red with the scrubbing she did on the sour old walls. Ewan said she was daft, the place was fine, what more did she want? And she said <i>Less dirt;</i> and that maybe he liked dirt, she didn&#8217;t; and he laughed <i>Well, maybe I do, I like you right well!</i> and put his arm round her shoulders and they stood and kissed in the mid of the heaped and littered kitchen&#8212;awful to be like that, said Chris, they could hardly be sane.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March the weather broke, the rain came down in plashing pelts, you could hardly see a hand&#8217;s-length in front of your face if you ran through the close. Ewan sat in the barn, winnowing corn or tying ropes, or just smoking and swearing out at the rain. Chae Strachan came up for a talk on the second day, all in oilskins he came; and he sat in the barn with Ewan and said he&#8217;d seen it rain like this in Alaska, and the mountains move when the snows were melting. And Ewan said he didn&#8217;t care a damn though Alaska moved under the sea the morn, when would it clear on Blawearie? Munro came next, then Mutch of Bridge End, they&#8217;d nothing on their hands but watch the rain and shake their heads and swear they were all fair ruined.</p>

<p>But at last it went, the unending rain of a fortnight went, and that morning they woke and found it fine, Ewan took him a look at the land from the bedroom window and prompt lay back in the bed again. <i>Damn Blawearie and all that&#8217;s on&#8217;t, let&#8217;s have a holiday the day, Chris quean.</i> She said <i>I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m cleaning the garret,</i> and Ewan got angered, she&#8217;d never seen him angry like that before, Highland and foreign then, spitting like a cat. <i>Are you to spend all your days cleaning damned rooms? You&#8217;ll be old and wizened and a second Mistress Munro before you&#8217;re well twenty. Off on a holiday we&#8217;re going to-day.</i></p>

<p>And, secretly glad, she lay back, lying with her hands under her head, lazy, and looking at him, thinking how different he was from that lad she&#8217;d tramped to Dunnottar with, so close she knew him now, the way he thought and the things he liked and his kindness and slowness to take offence, and the bitter offence, how it rankled in him, once it was there! Like and not like what she&#8217;d thought and wanted in those days before they had married. Spite of their closest moments together, Ewan could still blush at a look or a touch of hers; she touched him then to make sure, and he did! He said <i>Hold off! you&#8217;re a shameless limmer, for sure, and not nineteen yet. Come on, let&#8217;s get out and get off.</i></p>

<p>So they raced through the morning&#8217;s work and by nine were down at the Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, and borrowed Chae&#8217;s gig and heard Chae promise to milk and take in Blawearie&#8217;s kye. Then out they drove and swung left through Kinraddie, into the Laurencekirk road, the sun shining and the peewits calling, there were snipe in a loch they passed, the North Sea was gloom-away by Bervie as the sholtie trotted south. You could see then as the land rose higher the low parks that sloped to the woods and steeple of Drumlithie, beyond that the hills of Barras, the Reisk in its hollow among its larch-woods. West of that rose Arbuthnott, a fair jumble of bent and brae, Fordoun came marching up the horizon in front of them then, and they were soon going through it. Ewan said if he bided in Fordoun he&#8217;d lay his neck on the railway line and invite the Flying Scotsman to run over it, so tired he&#8217;d be of biding in a place that looked like a barn painted by a man with nothing but thumbs and a squint in both eyes.</p>

<p>But Chris liked the little place, she&#8217;d never seen it before and the farms that lay about it, big and rich, with fine black loam for soil, different from the clay of bleak Blawearie. Ewan said <i>To hell with them and their fine land too, they&#8217;re not farmers, them, only lazy muckers that sit and make silver out of their cotters;</i> and he said he&#8217;d rather bide in a town and wear a damned apron than work in this countryside. And then they were near Laurencekirk, the best of weather the day held still, Laurencekirk looked brave in the forenoon stir, with its cattle mart and its printing office where they printed weekly the <i>Kincardineshire Observer,</i> folk called it <i>The Squeaker</i> for short. It had aye had a hate for Stonehaven, Laurencekirk, and some said that it should be the county capital, but others said God help the capital that was entrusted to it; and would speak a bit verse that Thomas the Rhymour had made, how ere Rome&#8212;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>      became a great imperial city,<br>
Twas peopled first, as we are told,<br>

By pirates, robbers, thieves, banditti;<br>
Quoth Tammas: &#8216;Then the day may come<br>
When Laurencekirk shall equal Rome.&#8217;</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when Laurencekirk folk heard that they would laugh, not nearly cry as they did in Drumlithie when you mocked at their steeple, or smile sick and genteel as they did in Stonehaven when you spoke of the poverty toffs. Ewan said it was a fine town, he liked Laurencekirk, and they&#8217;d stop and have dinner there.</p>

<p>So they did, it was fine to eat food that another had cooked. Then they looked at the day and saw how it wore and planned to drive over to Edzell Castle&#8212;<i>There&#8217;s nothing to see there but a ruckle of stones,</i> said Ewan, <i>but you&#8217;ll like them fine, no doubt.</i></p>

<p>So they did as they&#8217;d planned, the afternoon flew, it was golden and green. Under Drumtochty Hill they passed, Ewan told that in summer it came deeper with the purple of heather than any other hill in Scotland; but it hung dark and asleep like a great cloud scraping the earth as they trotted past. There was never a soul at the castle but themselves, they climbed and clambered about in the ruins, stone on stone they were crumbling away, there were little dark chambers in the angle walls that had sheltered the bowmen long syne. Ewan said they must fair have been fusionless folk, the bowmen, to live in places like that; and Chris laughed and looked at him, queer and sorry, and glimpsed the remoteness that her books had made.</p>

<p>She was glad to be out in the sun again, though, clouds were racing it up from the North and Ewan said they&#8217;d not need to loiter long. In the garden of the castle they wandered from wall to wall, looking at the pictures crumbling there, balls and roses and rings and callipers, and wild heraldic beasts without number, Ewan said he was glad that they&#8217;d all been killed. But Chris didn&#8217;t laugh at him, she knew right well that such beasts had never been, but she felt fey that day, even out here she grew chill where the long grasses stood in the sun, the dead garden about them with its dead stone beasts of an ill-stomached fancy.</p>

<p>Folk rich and brave, and blithe and young as themselves, had once walked and talked and taken their pleasure here, and their play was done and they were gone, they had no name or remembered place, even in the lands of death they were maybe forgotten, for maybe the dead died once again, and again went on. And, daft-like, she tried to tell Ewan that whimsy, and he stared at her, pushing his cap from his brow, and looked puzzled and said <i>Ay,</i> half-heartedly; he didn&#8217;t know what she blithered about. She laughed then and turned away from him, angry at herself and her daftness; but once she&#8217;d thought there wouldn&#8217;t be a thing they wouldn&#8217;t understand together.</p>

<p>And the rain that had held away all the day came down at last and caught them on their way back home, overtaking them near to Laurencekirk, in a blinding surge that they watched come hissing across the fields, the sholtie bent its head to the storm and trotted on cannily, it grew dark all of a moment and Ewan found there was never a lamp on Chae&#8217;s bit gig. He swore at Chae and then drove in silence, and the wind began to rise as they came on the long, bare road past Fordoun, near lifting the sholt from its feet; and out in the darkness they heard the foghorn moaning by Todhead lighthouse. They were a pair of drooked rats when they turned the gig into the close at Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, and Chae cried to them to come in and dry, but they wouldn&#8217;t, they ran all the way to Blawearie and the wet trees were creaking in the wind as they reached to their door.</p>

<p>Now that was the last wet day of the Spring and to Chris the weeks began to slip by like posts you glimpse from the fleeing window of a railway train in a day of summer&#8212;light and shade and marled wood, light and shade, and the whoom of the train, life itself seemed to fly like that up through the Spring, Ewan had the corn land all ploughed and sown himself almost early as was the Mains; only in the yavil did Chris go out and carry the corn for him.</p>

<p>And that she liked fine, not a chave and a weariness as it was with father, Ewan brisk and cheerful with the smoulder gone from his eyes, they had settled to a clear, slow shining, it seemed to Chris, now he had his own home and wife. Then in the days of the harrowing Chris drove the harrows while he carted manure to the turnip-land, she was glad that she hadn&#8217;t that work, glad to tramp behind the horses instead, with kilted skirts, a switch in her hand and the reins there and the horses plod-plodding steadily, they knew her fine, and she spoiled them with bits of loaf and jam so that Ewan, coming to drive them himself, cried vexedly, <i>Hold up your head from my pockets, Clyde! What the hell are you sniff-sniff-sniffing for?</i></p>

<p>Then he went down to Stonehaven and bought a new sower and sowed the turnips; and the night he finished and unloosed and came back to the biggings for his supper, he couldn&#8217;t find Chris though he called and called. She heard him calling and didn&#8217;t answer, herself lying out in the garden under the beeches, brave and green and rustling their new Spring leaves, whispering without cease over her head that was buried in the grass while she lay and thought. A little insect ran over her hand and she hated it, but it mightn&#8217;t disturb her for this time at the least, nothing might do that, she lay so certain and still because of this thing that had come to her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She felt neither gladness nor pain, only dazed, as though running in the fields with Ewan she had struck against a great stone, body and legs and arms, and lay stunned and bruised, the running and the fine crying in the sweet air still on about her, Ewan running free and careless still not knowing or heeding the thing she had met. The days of love and holidaying and the foolishness of kisses&#8212;they might be for him yet but never the same for her, dreams were fulfilled and their days put by, the hills climbed still to sunset but her heart might climb with them never again and long for to-morrow, the night still her own. No night would she ever be her own again, in her body the seed of that pleasure she had sown with Ewan burgeoning and growing, dark, in the warmth below her heart. And Chris Guthrie crept out from the place below the beech trees where Chris Tavendale lay and went wandering off into the waiting quiet of the afternoon, Chris Tavendale heard her go, and she came back to Blawearie never again.</p>

<p>But she did not tell Ewan, not that night nor the week that followed, nor the weeks after that, watching her own body with a secret care and fluttering eyes for the marks and stigmata of this thing that had come to her. And she saw her breast nipples change and harden and grow soft again, the breasts that Ewan had kissed and thought the wonder of God, a maid&#8217;s breasts a maid&#8217;s no longer, changing in slow rhythm of purpose with the sway and measure of each note in the rhythm, her belly rounding to plumpness below the navel, she looked in the glass and saw also her eyes changed, deeper and most strange, with red lights and veinings set in them.</p>

<p>And in the silences of the night, when the whit-owl had quieted out by the barn, once something moved there under her heart, moved and stirred drowsily, a sleeper from dreams; and she gasped and cried and then lay still, not wakening Ewan, for this was her rig and furrow, she had brought him the unsown field and the tending and reaping was hers, even as with herself when she lay in her own mother&#8217;s body. And she thought of that, queer it seemed then how unclearly she had thought of that aforetime, shamed, indecent and coarse for a quean to think of such things&#8212;that her mother had once carried her as seed and fruit and dark movingness of flesh hid away within her.</p>

<p>And she wakened more fully at that, lying thinking while Ewan slept at her side, turned away from him, thinking of mother, not as her mother at all, just as Jean Murdoch, another woman who had faced this terror-daze in the night. They went sleepless in the long, dark hours for the fruitage of love that the sower slept all unaware, they were the plants that stood dark and quiet in the night, unmoving, immobile, the bee hummed home and away, drowsy with treasure, and another to-morrow for the hunting his.</p>

<p>So was the way of things, there was the wall and the prison that you couldn&#8217;t break down, there was nothing to be done&#8212;nothing, though your heart stirred from its daze and suddenly the frozenness melted from you and still you might not sleep&#8230; . But now it was because of that babble of words that went round and around in your mind, soundless and scared of your lips, a babble of hours in the hills and loitering by lochs and the splendour of books and sleeping secure&#8212;babble of a world that still marched and cried beyond the prison walls, fair and unutterable its loveliness still outside the doors of Blawearie house, mocked by its ghost, a crying in the night for things that were lost and foregone and ended.</p>

<p>It quietened away then, morning came tapping at the window, she turned and slept, sleeping exhausted, rising with white face and slow steps so that she was long in the kitchen. And Ewan came hasting in, hurried that morning, the first of the turnips were pushing their thin, sweet blades of grass above the drills, he wanted to be out to them. <i>Damn&#8217;t, Chris, are you still asleep?</i> he cried, half-laughing, half-angry, and Chris said nothing, going back to the dairy, Ewan stared and then moved uneasily and followed her with hesitant feet, <i>What&#8217;s wrong? What&#8217;s up?</i></p>

<p>Turning to look at him, suddenly Chris knew that she hated him, standing there with the health in his face, clear of eyes&#8212;every day they grew clearer here in the parks he loved and thought of noon, morning and night; that, and the tending to beasts and the grooming of horses, herself to warm him at night and set him his meat by day. <i>What are you glowering for?</i> he asked, and she spoke then at last, calmly and thinly, <i>For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t deave me. Must you aye be an old wife and come trailing after me wherever I go?</i></p>

<p>He flinched like a horse with the lash on its back, his eyes kindled their smoky glow, but he swung round and away from her. <i>You&#8217;re out of bed the wrong side this morning,</i> and out he went. She was sorry then, wanted to cry to him, dropped the pails to run after him, when he spoilt it all, crying from the middle of the close: <i>And I&#8217;d like my breakfast before the night comes down.</i></p>

<p>It was as though she were dry whin and his speech a fire to it, she ran out and overtook him there in the close, catching his shoulder and whirling him round, so surprised he was that he almost fell. <i>Speak to me like that?</i> she cried, <i>Do you think I&#8217;m your servant? You&#8217;re mine, mind that, living off my meat and my milk, you Highland pauper! &#8230;</i> More than that she said, so she knew, no memory of the words abided with her, it was a blur of rage out of which she came with Ewan holding her shoulders and shaking her: <i>You damned bitch, you&#8217;d say that to me? To me? &#8230;</i> he was glaring like a beast, then he seemed to crumple, his hands fell from her. <i>Och, you&#8217;re ill, you should be in your bed!</i></p>

<p>He left her in the close then, striding to the barn, she stood like a fool with the tears of rage and remorse blinding her eyes. And as she went back to the kitchen and came out with the pails Ewan went striding away over the fields, his hoe on his shoulder, it was barely yet light, he was going to the parks without his breakfast. Milking the kye she hurried, her anger dying away, hurrying to be finished and have the breakfast ready, for he&#8217;d sure to be back again soon.</p>

<p>So she planned; but Ewan didn&#8217;t come back. The porridge hottered to a thick, tough mess, beyond the raised blind the day broke thick and evilly red, hot like a pouring steam across the hills; the tea grew cold. Herself half-desperate with hunger she waited, couldn&#8217;t sit, wandering from fire to door and door to table; and then she caught sight on the dresser of the whistle that had lain by father while he lay in paralysis in bed, and snatched it down, and all in a moment had run over the close to the lithe of the corn ricks.</p>

<p>Shading her eyes she saw Ewan then, down in the turnip-park, swinging steady and quick in lunge and recovery, Kinraddie&#8217;s best hoer. Then she whistled to him loud and clear down through the morning, half Kinraddie must have heard the blast, but he took no notice. Then she went desperate in a way, she stopped from whistling and screamed to him, <i>Ewan, Ewan!</i> and at her first scream he looked up and dropped his hoe&#8212;he&#8217;d heard her whistling all right, the thrawn swine! She screamed again, he was running by then over the parks to the close; him not ten yards away she screamed a third time, hurting her throat, but she did it calmly, anger boiled in her, yet in a way she was cool enough.</p>

<p>And Ewan cried <i>God, Chris, have you gone clean daft? What are you screaming for, what do you want?</i> He towered up above her, angry, amazed, it was then that she knew for sure, she gathered up all the force in her voice and body for the reply that sprang to her lips and the thing that followed it. <i>That!</i> she said, and struck him across the face with her arm&#8217;s full force, her fingers cried agony and then went numb, on Ewan&#8217;s face a great red mark sprang up, the clap of the blow went echoing around the Blawearie biggings.</p>

<p>So she saw and heard, only a moment, next minute he was at her himself like a cat, her head rang and dirled as he struck her twice, she tried to keep her footing and failed and fell back, against the rick-side, clutching at the thing, staring feared at Ewan, the madness on his face, his fists coming up again. <i>Get up, get up!</i> he cried, <i>Damn you, get up!</i> and she knew he would strike her again, and rising shielded her face with her arm, trying to cram back the sobs in her throat, too late for that. Dizzy, she saw him in front of her swaying and moving, she couldn&#8217;t see him but she cried <i>No, no!</i> and turned then and ran stumbling up through the close, up the hill to the moor. Twice he called as she ran, the second time so that nearly she stopped, <i>Chris, Chris, come back!</i> in a voice that was breaking as her own had been. But she couldn&#8217;t stop running, a hare that the snare had whipped. <i>Never again, never again, the loch, the loch!</i> she sobbed as she ran and panted, the Standing Stones wheeling up from the whins to peer with quiet faces then in her face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour, half an hour, how long had she lain and dozed? Still morning in the air, she was soaked with dew. She turned and half-rose, heard the whistling of the broom and sank down again.</p>

<p>It was Ewan by the moor-gate, searching, he&#8217;d stopped to stare at the loch, thinking the thing she had thought, not seeing her yet. She sighed. She felt tired as though she had worked a great day in the sweat of the land, but Ewan would see to her, Ewan would take heed.</p>

<p>So she raised her voice and called to him and he came.</p>

<h3>TWO</h3>

<h3>Drilling</h3>

<p>Lying down when her climb up the cambered brae was done, panting deep from the rate she&#8217;d come at&#8212;skirt flying and iron-resolute she&#8217;d turn back for nothing that cried or called in all Blawearie&#8212;no, not even that whistle of father&#8217;s!&#8212;Chris felt the coarse grass crackle up beneath her into a fine quiet couch. Neck and shoulders and hips and knees she relaxed, her long brown arms quivered by her side as the muscles slacked away, the day drowsed down an aureal light through the long brown lashes that drooped on her cheeks. As the gnomons of a giant dial the shadows of the Standing Stones crept into the east, snipe called and called&#8212;</p>

<p>Just as the last time she&#8217;d climbed to the loch: and when had that been? She opened her eyes and thought, and tired from that and closed down her eyes again and gave a queer laugh. The June of last year it had been, the day when mother had poisoned herself and the twins.</p>

<p>So long as that and so near as that, you&#8217;d thought of the hours and days as a dark, cold pit you&#8217;d never escape. But you&#8217;d escaped, the black damp went out of the sunshine and the world went on, the white faces and whispering ceased from the pit, you&#8217;d never be the same again, but the world went on and you went with it. It was not mother only that died with the twins, something died in your heart and went down with her to lie in Kinraddie kirkyard&#8212;the child in your heart died then, the bairn that believed the hills were made for its play, every road set fair with its warning posts, hands ready to snatch you back from the brink of danger when the play grew over-rough. That died, and the Chris of the books and the dreams died with it, or you folded them up in their paper of tissue and laid them away by the dark, quiet corpse that was your childhood.</p>

<p>So Mistress Munro of the Cuddiestoun told her that awful night she came over the rain-soaked parks of Blawearie and laid out the body of mother, the bodies of the twins that had died so quiet in their crib. She nipped round the rooms right quick and pert and uncaring, the black-eyed futret, snapping this order and that, it was her that terrified Dod and Alec from their crying, drove father and Will out tending the beasts. And quick and cool and cold-handed she worked, peeking over at Chris with her rat-like face. <i>You&#8217;ll be leaving the College now, I&#8217;ll warrant, education&#8217;s dirt and you&#8217;re better clear of it. You&#8217;ll find little time for dreaming and dirt when you&#8217;re keeping the house at Blawearie.</i></p>

<p>And Chris in her pit, dazed and dull-eyed, said nothing, she minded later; and some other than herself went searching and seeking out cloths and clothes. Then Mistress Munro washed down the body that was mother&#8217;s and put it in a night-gown, her best, the one with blue ribbons on it that she hadn&#8217;t worn for many a year; and fair she made her and sweet to look at, the tears came at last when you saw her so, hot tears wrung from your eyes like drops of blood. But they ended quick, you would die if you wept like that for long, in place of tears a long wail clamoured endless, unanswered inside your head, <i>Oh, mother, mother, why did you do it?</i></p>

<p>And not until days later did Chris hear why, for they tried to keep it from her and the boys, but it all came out at the inquest, mother had poisoned herself, her and the twins, because she was pregnant again and afraid with a fear dreadful and calm and clear-eyed. So she had killed herself while of unsound mind, had mother, kind-eyed and sweet, remembering those Springs of Kildrummie last of all things remembered, it may be, and the rooks that cried across the upland parks of Don far down beyond the tunnels of the years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A month later Dod and Alec went back to school and as they left to go home that night first one scholar cried after them and others took it up <i>Daftie, daftie! Whose mother was a daftie?</i> They ran for Blawearie and came stumbling into the house weeping and weeping, father went fair mad at the sight of them and skelped them both, but skelping or not they wouldn&#8217;t go back to the school next day.</p>

<p>And then Will spoke up, he cared not a fig for father now. All in a night it seemed the knowledge had come on him father wouldn&#8217;t dare strike him again, he bought an old bicycle and would ride off in an evening as he pleased, his face cold and hard when he caught the glint of father&#8217;s eye. Of a morning John Guthrie grumbled and girned at him, crying <i>Where do you wander each night like a tink?</i> But Will would say never a word, except once when John Guthrie made at him and then he swung round and whispered <i>Take care.</i> And at that father stopped and drew back, Chris watched them with angry eyes, angry and frightened in a breath as now when Will spoke up for his brothers.</p>

<p><i>Why should they go back? I wouldn&#8217;t. Oh, and you needn&#8217;t glower at me. You take damn good care you never go near a mart or a market yourself nowadays&#8212;I&#8217;ve to do all your dirty work for you!</i></p>

<p>Father louped to his feet at that, Will was on his as well, they stood with fists clenched in the kitchen and Dod and Alec stopped from their greeting and stared and stared. But Chris thrust the table in between the two, she made out she wanted it there for baking; and they dropped their fists and John Guthrie swore, but soft; and Will reddened up and looked foolish.</p>

<p>But father that night, he said never a word to the rest of them in Blawearie, he was over-proud for that, wrote off to his sister Janet in Auchterless and asked that she take Dod and Alec in her care and give them an Aberdeen schooling. In a week she was down from the North, Auntie Janet and her man. Uncle Tam he was, big and well-bulked and brave, and his watch-chain had rows and rows of wee medals on it he&#8217;d gotten for playing quoits. And they were fell kind, the two of them, Alec and Dod were daft with delight when they heard of the Auchterless plan. But Auntie and Uncle had never a bairn of their own and soon made plain if the boys went with them it would be for aye, they wanted to adopt the pair of them.</p>

<p>Father sneered and thrust out his beard at that <i>So you&#8217;d like to steal the flesh of my body from me?</i> and Auntie Janet nodded, right eye to eye, <i>Aye, John, just that, we&#8217;ve never a wean of our own, though God knows it&#8217;s not for want of the trying;</i> and father said <i>Ill blood breeds ill;</i> and Auntie said <i>Ay, it&#8217;ll be long ere I have to kill myself because my man beds me like a breeding sow;</i> and father said <i>You dirty bitch.</i></p>

<p>Chris stuck the dirl of the row till her head near burst and then ran out of the kitchen, through the close into the cornyard, where Will was prowling about. He&#8217;d heard the noise and he laughed at them, but his eyes were angry as his arm went round her. <i>Never heed the dirty old devils, one&#8217;s bad as the other, father, auntie, or that midden that&#8217;s covered with its wee tin medals. Come off to the park with me and we&#8217;ll bring home the kye.</i></p>

<p>Deep in clover the cows as they came on them, Chris and Will; and they went in no hurry at all, unanxious to be back in Blawearie. And Will seemed angry and gentle and kind all at once. <i>Don&#8217;t let them worry you, Chris, don&#8217;t let father make a damned slave of you, as he&#8217;d like to do. We&#8217;ve our own lives to lead.</i> And she said <i>What else can I do but bide at home now?</i></p>

<p>He said he didn&#8217;t know, but he&#8217;d be libbed and poleaxed and gutted if <i>he</i> did for long, soon as he&#8217;d saved the silver he was off to Canada, a man was soon his own master there. Chris listened to that with eyes wide opened, she caught at the hope of it and forgot to smack at the kye that loitered and boxed and galumphed in their cloverful-foolishness up the brae. <i>Oh, Will, and you could send for me as your housekeeper!</i> He turned a dull red and smacked at the kye and Chris sighed and the hope went out, he&#8217;d no need to answer <i>Ay, maybe, but maybe it would hardly suit you.</i></p>

<p>So then she knew for sure he&#8217;d a lass somewhere in Drumlithie, it was with her he planned to share a bed and a steading in the couthy lands of Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when they got back to Blawearie they found the row ended, father&#8217;d given in to his sister Janet, ill the grace though he did it with. In three days time but three of them were sitting to meat at the kitchen table, Chris listened for days for voices of folk that were dead or gone, both far enough from Blawearie. But even that lost strangeness in time, the harvest drew on, she went out to the park to help with it, lush and heavy enough it had sprung and yellowed with the suns and rains of the last two months.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d no binder, father, wouldn&#8217;t hear of the things, but he&#8217;d brought an old reaper from Echt and with that they cut the corn; though Will swore he&#8217;d be the fool of Kinraddie seen driving a thing like that. Father laughed at him over his beard, like a spitting cat, <i>If Kinraddie&#8217;s laughing can make you a bigger fool than nature made you it&#8217;ll be a miracle, and don&#8217;t fret the sark from your dowp, my mannie, I&#8217;LL do the driving.</i> And though Will muttered at that he gave in all the same, for every harvest there came something queer and terrible on father, you couldn&#8217;t handle the thing with a name, it was as if he grew stronger and crueller then, ripe and strong with the strength of the corn, he&#8217;d be fleeter than ever and his face filled out, and they&#8217;d hear him come up from the parks, astride the broad back of Bess, singing hymns, these were the only things that he ever sang, singing with a queer, keen shrillness that brought the sweat in the palms of your hands.</p>

<p>Now in the park below Blawearie, steading and house, the best crop, and that was the ley, was the first they cut, a great swither of a crop with straw you could hardly break and twist into bands for sheaves. Sore work Chris found it to keep her stretch of each bout cleared for the reaper&#8217;s coming, the weather cool and grey though it was. But a sun was behind the greyness and sometimes when you raised your head from the sheaves you&#8217;d see a beam of light on the travel far over the parks of Upperhill or lazing across the moor or dancing a-top the Cuddiestoun stooks, a beam from the hot, grey haze of that sky that watched and waited above the sweat of the harvesting Howe.</p>

<p>First ere the cutting in the ley began there&#8217;d been roads to clear all round the corn, wide bouts that father scythed himself, he swore that the scythe would yet come back to its own when the binders and reapers rotted in rust and folk bred the old breed again. But its time was past or was yet to come, the scythe&#8217;s, out the reaper was driven and yoked, Chris followed down at the tail of it. The best of weather for harvest, folk said, it was ill to cut in a swither of heat; and so still was the air by morn and noon it reminded you of the days in Spring, you&#8217;d hear the skirl of the blades ring down the Howe for mile on mile, the singing of Long Rob of the Mill, the Cuddiestoun creatures swearing at Tony as he stood and gowked at the stooks. Then Blawearie&#8217;s reaper clanged in through the gates with Bess and Clyde at the pole, and the blades flashed and brightened like the teeth of a beast and snarled in a famished freedom. And then John Guthrie cried <i>Get up!</i> and swung the horses down the bout, and the hungry snarl changed to a deep, clogged growling as the corn was driven on the teeth by the swinging reaper flails; and down the bout, steady and fine, sped the reaper, clean-cutting from top to bottom, with never a straggling straw as on other farms, John Guthrie saw to that.</p>

<p>But feint the time had you for glowering at rip or reaper, soon as the horses were off and the flail drove the first sheaf from the tail-board Chris had pounced on that sheaf and gathered and bound it and flung it aside before you could say <i>Glenbervie!</i> and had run to the next and twisted its band, and gathered and bound and bound and gathered with her hands like a mist below her eyes, so quick they were. Midway the bout Will met with her, working up from the foot, and flicking the sweat from his face. And just as they straightened and stretched and looked up to the head of the park the clong, clong of the empty reaper would change to the snarling engaging whirr as father guided the horses to the cutting again. Still the sun smouldered behind its mists and out by Kinneff the fog-horn moaned all hours, you felt like moaning like that yourself long ere the day was out and your back near cracked and broke with the strain of the bending.</p>

<p>But in three days time the ley was cut, the yavil glowed yellow across the dykes and they moved to that without stop. And then suddenly the mists cleared up and the fog-horn stopped from its droning, it came on real blistering weather of heat, but hardly you&#8217;d bear to touch on the wood of the reaper shaft when you loosed the horses, so hot it grew. Kinraddie gasped and then bent to its chaving again, this heat wouldn&#8217;t last, the rain was due, God help the crops that waited cutting then.</p>

<p>The second day of the yavil cutting a tink climbed up the Blawearie road from the turnpike and cried to John Guthrie for work, and father said <i>Maybe, maybe. Let&#8217;s see the work that you&#8217;ve in you first,</i> and the tink said <i>Ay, fine that.</i> And he off with his coat and took the middle of the bout, and was up it in a jiffy, gathering and binding to the manner born, you might say, and giving Chris a bit smile when he met with her. So, coming down the next bout father cried to the tink that he&#8217;d take him on for a day or so, if the weather held; and Chris could get up to the house and see to the supper&#8212;<i>no idling, quean, mind that.</i> He was a black-like, gypsy childe, the tink, father wouldn&#8217;t have him into the kitchen for meat, the creature might be all lice; and he wouldn&#8217;t have him sleep in the house.</p>

<p>So Chris made him a shake-down out in the barn, he said he was real content with that. But when she carried him his supper over to the barn the first night she felt shamed for him suddenly, and told him she&#8217;d have had him eat in the house if it hadn&#8217;t been father. And he said <i>Don&#8217;t let that fash you, lass, I&#8217;m as little anxious for his company as he is for mine. Forbye, he&#8217;s only a Kinraddie clown!</i> Chris felt her face flame at that, it just showed you there was no good doing kindness to tinks, but she made out she hadn&#8217;t heard and turned back to go over the close.</p>

<p>Then it was the tink put out his arm, round her legs before she could move, almost he pulled her down on the hay beside him. <i>You&#8217;ve never lain with a man yet, lass, I can see, and that&#8217;s a sore waste of hot blood like yours. So mind I&#8217;m here if you want me, I&#8217;ve deflowered more queans than I&#8217;ve years to my name and sent none of them empty away.</i> He loosed her then, laughing low, she couldn&#8217;t do anything but stare and stare at him, sick and not angry, something turned in her stomach and her knees felt weak. The tink put out his hand and patted her leg again, <i>Mind, if you want me I&#8217;ll be here,</i> and Chris shook her head, she felt too sick to speak, and slipped out of the barn and crossed the close and washed and washed at her hands and face with hot water till father lowered his paper and asked <i>Have you gone clean daft?</i></p>

<p>But up in her room that night, the room that was hers and hers only now, Will slept where his brothers had slept, she saw a great moon come over the Grampians as she undressed for bed. She opened the window then, she liked to sleep with it open, and it was as though the night had been waiting for that, a waft of the autumn wind blew in, it was warm and cool and it blew in her face with a smell like the smell of late clover and the smell of dung and the smell of the stubble fields all commingled.</p>

<p>She leant there breathing it, watching the moon with the hills below it but higher than Blawearie, Kinraddie slept like a place in a picture-book, drifting long shadows that danced a petronella across the night-stilled parks. And without beginning or reason a strange ache came in her, in her breasts, so that they tingled, and in her throat, and below her heart, and she heard her heart beating, and for a minute the sound of the blood beating through her own head. And she thought of the tink lying there in the barn and how easy it would be to steal down the stairs and across the close, dense black in its shadows, to the barn.</p>

<p>But it was only for a second she thought of that, daftly, then laughed at herself, cool and trim and trig, and closed the window, shutting out the smells of the night, and slowly took off her clothes, looking at herself in the long glass that had once stood in mother&#8217;s room. She was growing up limber and sweet, not bonny, perhaps, her cheek-bones were over high and her nose over short for that, but her eyes clear and deep and brown, brown, deep and clear as the Denburn flow, and her hair was red and was brown by turns, spun fine as a spider&#8217;s web, wild, wonderful hair.</p>

<p>So she saw herself and her teeth clean-cut and even, a white gleam in that grave brown stillness of face John Guthrie&#8217;s blood had bequeathed to her. And below face and neck now her clothes were off was the glimmer of shoulders and breast and there her skin was like satin, it tickled her touching herself. Below the tilt of her left breast was a dimple, she saw it and bent to look at it and the moonlight ran down her back, so queer the moonlight she felt the running of that beam along her back. And she straightened as the moonlight grew and looked at the rest of herself, and thought herself sweet and cool and fit for that lover who would some day come and kiss her and hold her, so.</p>

<p>And Chris saw the brown glimmer of her face grow sweet and scared as she thought of that&#8212;how they&#8217;d lie together, in a room with moonlight, and she&#8217;d be kind to him, kind and kind, giving him all and everything, and he&#8217;d sleep with his head here on her breast or they&#8217;d lie far into the mornings whispering one to the other, they&#8217;d have so much to tell!</p>

<p>And maybe that third and last Chris would find voice at last for the whimsies that filled her eyes, and tell of rain on the roof at night, the terror and the splendour of it across the long slate roofs; and the years that faded and fell, dissolved as a breath, before those third clear eyes; and mother&#8217;s face, lying dead; and the Standing Stones up there night after night and day after day by the lock of Blawearie, how around them there gathered things that wept and laughed and lived again in the hours before the dawn, till far below the cocks began to crow in Kinraddie and day had come again. And all that he&#8217;d believe, more than so often she believed herself, not laugh at, holding and kissing her, so. And faith! no more than a corpse he&#8217;d hold if she didn&#8217;t get into her bed-gown and into her bed, you may dream of a lad till you&#8217;re frozen as a stone, but he&#8217;ll want you warmer than that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that was the harvest madness that came on Chris, mild enough it had been, she fell fast asleep in the middle of it. But it scored her mind as a long drill scores the crumbling sods of a brown, still May, it left neither pleasure nor pain, but she&#8217;d know that track all the days of her life, and its dark, long sweep across the long waiting field. Binder and reaper clattered and wheeped through the brittle weather that held the Howe, soon the weather might break and the stooking was far behind in Blawearie. But Will would have nothing to do with night-time work, he laughed in John Guthrie&#8217;s face at the mention of it and jumped on his bicycle and rode for Drumlithie evening on evening. Father would wander out by the biggins and stare at the parks and then come glinting into the house and glower at Chris, <i>Get off to your bed when you&#8217;ve milked the kye;</i> and she made little protest at that, she was tired enough at the end of a day to nearly sleep in the straw of the byre.</p>

<p>But one night she didn&#8217;t dare sleep, for up in the room he&#8217;d shared with mother she heard John Guthrie get out of bed and go slow padding about in his stocking soles, like a great cat padding there, a beast that sniffed and planned and smelled at the night. And once he came soft down the cowering creak of the stairs and stopped by her door, and she held her breath, near sick with fright, though what was there to be feared of? And she heard his breath come quick and gasping and the scuffle of his hand on the sneck of the door; and then that stopped, he must have gone up or down, the house was quiet, but she didn&#8217;t dare sleep again till Will came clattering home in the still, small hours.</p>

<p>For the harvest madness was out in Kinraddie if Chris had been quick to master hers. And though a lad and a quean might think their ongoings known to none but themselves, they&#8217;d soon be sore mistaken, you might hide with your lass on the top of Ben Nevis and have your bit pleasure there, but ten to one when you got up to go home there&#8217;d be Mistress Munro or some claik of her kidney, near sniggering herself daft with delight at your shame.</p>

<p>First it was Sarah Sinclair and the foreman at Upperhill, Ewan Tavendale he was, that the speak rose round: they&#8217;d been seen coming out of the larch wood above the Upperhill, that wood where the daftie had trapped Maggie Jean, and what had they been doing there on their lone? It was Alec Mutch of Bridge End that met them, him taking a dander over the moor to the smithy with a broken binder-blade for mending. The two hardly saw him at first, Miss Sinclair&#8217;s face was an unco sight, raddled with blushing it was like the leg of a tuberculous rabbit when you skinned the beast, Ewan slouched along at her side. hang-dog he looked as though it was his mother he&#8217;d bedded with, said Alec, and maybe that&#8217;s how it had felt. Alec cried a <i>Good night!</i> to the pair, they near jumped out of their skins, and went on with the story to the smithy beyond the moor. And from there you may well be sure it went through Kinraddie fast enough, the smith could tell lies faster than he could shoe horses; and he was fell champion at that.</p>

<p>Truth or no, Chae Strachan got hold of the story and went over to Upperhill to see Ewan Tavendale and ask in a friendly way what he meant to do about Sarah, his sister-in-law, the daft old trollop. And maybe he&#8217;d have settled things canty and fine but that he came on Ewan at the wrong bit minute, he was sitting outside the bothy door with the rest of the bothy billies; and when Chae came up there rose a bit snigger, that fair roused Chae, he stopped bang in front of them and asked what the hell they were laughing at? And Sam Gourlay said <i>Little, damned little,</i> looking Chae from head to foot; and Ewan said he felt more in the way of weeping than laughing at such a sight, and he spoke in a slow, impudent way that fair roused Chae&#8217;s dander to the boiling point.</p>

<p>So, being a fell impatient man, and skilly with his hands, he took Sam Gourlay a clout in the lug that couped him down in the stour and then before you could wink he and Ewan were at it, ding-dong, like a pair of tinks, all round the Upperhill close; and Upprums came running in his leggings, the creature, fair scandalized, but he got a shove in the guts that couped him right down in the greip where once his son Jock had been so mischieved; and that was the end of <i>his</i> interfering. In a minute or so it was plain that Ewan, fight though he might, was like to have the worst of the sett, he was no match for that madman Chae. So the rest of the bothy lads up and went for Chae; and when he got back to Peesie&#8217;s Knapp he&#8217;d hardly a stitch on his back. But Ewan, the coarse, dour brute, had a cut in the face that stopped <i>his</i> mouth for a while, and a black eye big enough to sole the boots on Cuddiestoun&#8217;s meikle feet, folk said.</p>

<p>And faith! if it shouldn&#8217;t be Cuddiestoun himself that began the next story, running into the middle of it himself, you might say, going up to the Manse to get a bit signature on some paper or other for his lawyer man. But Mr. Gibbon they told him wasn&#8217;t at home, Mistress Gibbon herself came out to tell him that, kind and fine as she was, but he didn&#8217;t like her, the English dirt.</p>

<p>So, fair disgruntled he turned from the door, maybe the poor brute&#8217;s big sweating feet were fell sore already with a hot day&#8217;s stooking. But just down at the end of the Manse&#8217;s garden, where the yews bent thick above the lush grass their boughs that had sheltered the lost childe Wallace in the days before the coarse English ran him to earth and took him to London and there hanged and libbed him and hewed his body in four to hang on the gates of Scotland&#8212;there, in that grass in the half-dark was a rustling and squealing as though a drove of young pigs was rootling there. And Cuddiestoun stopped and picked up a handful of gravel from the minister&#8217;s walk and flung it into the grass and cried <i>Away with you!</i> for maybe it was dogs in heat that were chaving there, big collies are none so chancy to meet when the creatures are set for mating. But instead of a collie up out of the grass rose the Gourdon quean, her that old Mistress Sinclair had fee&#8217;d for the Manse; and Munro saw her face then with a glazed look on it, like the face of a pig below the knife of its killer; and she brushed the hair from her face, daft-like, and went trailing past Munro, without a word from her, as though she walked half-asleep.</p>

<p>But past him, going into the Manse, she began to whistle, and laughed a loud scraich of a laugh&#8212;as though she&#8217;d tried right desperately for something, and won, and beaten all the world in the winning of it. So it seemed to Cuddiestoun, and faith! you couldn&#8217;t put that down to imagination, for he&#8217;d never had any, the ugly stock; so fair queer it must well have been, he stood and stared after her, dumbfoundered-like, and was just turning at last, to tramp down to the road, when he found Mr. Gibbon himself at his elbow.</p>

<p>It had grown fell dark by then but not so dark that Cuddiestoun couldn&#8217;t see the Minister was without a hat and was breathing in great deep paichs as though he&#8217;d come from the running of a race. And he barked out, <i>Well, speak up, man, what do you want?</i> Munro was sore took aback at hearing a fine childe like the minister snap at him that way. So he just said <i>Well, well, Mr. Gibbon, you&#8217;ve surely been running a bit race?</i> and then he wished he hadn&#8217;t, for the minister went by him without another word, and then flung over his shoulder <i>If you want me, come to-morrow.</i></p>

<p>And into the Manse he went and banged the door with a clash that fair made Cuddiestoun loup in his meikle boots. So there was nothing for him but to taik away home to Mistress Munro, and faith! you might well believe the story lost nothing in the telling she gave it, and soon every soul in Kinraddie had a different version, Long Rob&#8217;s was cried to John Guthrie as he went by the Mill. He never spread scandal about folk, Long Rob&#8212;only horses, was the joke they told of him&#8212;but maybe he classed ministers lower than them.</p>

<p>It seemed like enough to John Guthrie, the story, though he&#8217;d no coarse notions like Rob and his Ingersoll, the world was rolling fast to a hell of riches and the old slave days come back again, ministers went with it and whored with the rest. For the bitterness had grown and eaten away into the heart of him in his year at Blawearie. So coarse the land proved in the turn of the seasons he&#8217;d fair been staggered, the crops had fared none so bad this once, but he saw in a normal year the corn would come hardly at all on the long, stiff slopes of the dour red clay.</p>

<p>Now also it grew plain to him here as never in Echt that the day of the crofter was fell near finished, put by, the day of folk like himself and Chae and Cuddiestoun, Pooty and Long Rob of the Mill, the last of the farming folk that wrung their living from the land with their own bare hands. Sign of the times he saw Jean Guthrie&#8217;s killing of herself to shame him and make of his name a by-word in the mouths of his neighbours, sign of a time when women would take their own lives or flaunt their harlotries as they pleased, with the country-folk climbing on silver, the few, back in the pit, the many; and a darkness down on the land he loved better than his soul or God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And next it was Will himself that started the claiks of Kinraddie, him and his doings in Drumlithie. But Chris met the story ere it reached Kinraddie, she met it in Drumlithie itself, in the yard of the gardener Galt. The tink had been gone from Blawearie that day she set out with her basket, no sign of the rain showed even then, the heat held still as the white, dull heat from a furnace door. Down in the turnpike, the motor-cars went whipping by as she set her feet for Mondynes there where the battle was fought in the days long syne. Below the bridge went the wash of the burn west to the Bervie Water, bairns cried and splashed in the bridge&#8217;s lithe, they went naked there when they dared, she saw them glance white and startled in the shelter of the stones.</p>

<p>Soon the heat grew such that she took off her hat and swung that in her hand and so climbed the road, and there to the left rose Drumlithie at last, some called it Skite to torment the folk and they&#8217;d get fell angry at that in Skite. No more than a rickle of houses it was, white with sunshine below its steeple that made of Skite the laugh of the Howe, for feint the kirk was near it. Folk said for a joke that every time it came on to rain the Drumlithie folk ran out and took in their steeple, that proud they were of the thing, it came from the weaver days of the village when damn the clock was there in the place and its tolling told the hour.</p>

<p>So that was Skite, it rose out of its dusts and its ancient smells, the berries hung ripe in the yard of the gardener Galt and he looked at Chris in a queer kind of way when he heard her name. Syne he began a sly hinting and joking as he weighed her berries, a great sumph of a man the creature was, fair running with creash in that hot weather, you near melted yourself as you looked at him. <i>And how&#8217;s Will?</i> he asked. <i>We haven&#8217;t seen much of him here of late&#8212;faith, the roses are fair fading from Mollie Douglas&#8217; cheeks.</i> And Chris said <i>Oh?</i> right stiff-like, and then <i>And I&#8217;ll have two pounds of your blackberries too.</i> So he packed her that, hinting and gleying like a jokesome fat pig, she could have taken him a clout in the face, but didn&#8217;t, it would only stir up more scandal, there seemed enough and to spare of that. Whatever could Will have been doing; and what had he done to his quean that he&#8217;d left her?</p>

<p>Right glad she was to be out from the stink of Skite with the road of Mondynes in front of her. Then she heard the bell of a bicycle far down the road behind and drew to one side, but the thing didn&#8217;t pass, it slowed down and somebody called out, timid-like, <i>Are you Will Guthrie&#8217;s sister?</i> Chris turned and saw her then, knew her at once Will&#8217;s quean, young and white-faced and fair, and heard her own voice, near troubled as the eyes that looked at her as she answered <i>Yes; and you&#8217;ll be Mollie Douglas?</i></p>

<p>The face of the girl blushed slow at that, slow and sweet, and she looked away back at the steeple of Skite as though she feared the thing spied on them; and then suddenly, near crying, she was asking Chris to tell Will he must ride over and see her again, come again that night, she couldn&#8217;t bear it longer&#8212;she didn&#8217;t care were she shameless or not, she couldn&#8217;t! And then she seemed to read the question in Chris&#8217;s eyes, the blood drained off from her face in a minute and then came back, it seemed to Chris she must be blushing all over under her clothes, right down to the soles of her feet as she herself sometimes blushed. But she cried <i>Oh, you think THAT, like all of them, but it isn&#8217;t true!</i> Staring at her surprised and shamed Chris found she just couldn&#8217;t speak up and deny that THAT was indeed what she&#8217;d thought, what else was a body to think?</p>

<p>Then she found Mollie Douglas&#8217;s face bent close to hers, sweet and troubled and shamed as her own. And Mollie tried to look at her and then looked away, blushing as though she&#8217;d sink into the ground, such a fool of herself she was making. <i>It&#8217;s not that at all, only I love him so sore I can&#8217;t live if I don&#8217;t see Will!</i></p>

<p>So there they were in the middle of the road, so shamed to look one at the other they&#8217;d nothing to say; and then a gig came spanking along from the station, at sight of it Mollie jumped on her bicycle again, and wheeled it about, and looked over her shoulder with a smile you couldn&#8217;t forget, and stammered and cried <i>Ta-ta!</i></p>

<p>But Chris couldn&#8217;t forget that look in her eyes, she went home with that in her mind and at supper that night couldn&#8217;t take her own eyes from Will. She saw him then for the first time in years, almost a man, with his fair hair waving across his head and spreading to his cheeks in a rust-red down, like the down on a new-hatched chick; and his eyes blue and dark as a quean&#8217;s, and kind when they looked at her, sulky when they turned on father. Not that they turned there often, there was never a word between Will and father unless they were clean compelled to it; like dumb folk working and eating together that needed no speech for hate.</p>

<p>Father ate his supper and climbed down the hill with his gun, Will loitered from door to window, whistling and idle, till he saw right across the Howe, up on Drumtochty hills, something that rose and coiled ash-grey and then darker against the autumn sky, a great shape like a snake there in the quiet of the evening air, with its tail a glimmer that wasn&#8217;t the sunset, burning up red in the lithe of the hills. <i>Whin-burning,</i> he called to Chris, <i>they&#8217;re burning the whins up Drumtochty way, come on up the moor and have a try at ours. They&#8217;re damned sore in the need of it.&#8212;But I&#8217;ve my jelly to make, you gowk!&#8212;Oh, to hell with your jelly, we&#8217;ll soon be jelly and bones in a grave ourselves, come on!</i></p>

<p>So she went, they gathered great piles of old papers for twisting in torches, and made up the brae to the moor. They sat down on the grass and breathed a while, Kinraddie below them all cut and close-stooked, waiting the coming of the night, the lowe of the Bervie lights as the glow of another whin-burning there by the sea. They spread out to left and right below the moor-gate, Chris held to the left and ran through the whins, stopping to kick holes down close to the ground wherever a meikle bush rose up. Then far round the knowe Will cried he was starting, she saw him a long way off with the sky behind him and called back <i>All right!</i> and knelt by the biggest bush she&#8217;d struck; and kindled her torch and set its light to the crackling dryness of the grass.</p>

<p>It whoomed in an instant, the whin, she set her torch into it and ran to the next and fired that; and so in and out, backwards and forwards worked round the brae, you&#8217;d to speed quick as your legs could carry you to fire the frontward bushes when those behind raged out with their flames and smoke at your hair. In the dry, quiet evening the fire crackled up and spread and roared through the bushes and caught on the grass and crept and smoked on quick, searching trains to bushes unlit, and fired them, half you thought those questing tongues alive and malignant as they lapped through the grass. By the time Chris met with Will at the moor-gate there spread before them a park like an upland sea on fire, sweeping the hill, now the sun had quite gone and the great red roaring beast of a thing hunted and postured unchallenged, all Kinraddie was lit with its glare.</p>

<p>Will was black as a nigger, his eyebrows scorched, he pulled Chris down to rest on the grass. <i>By God, I hope the fire doesn&#8217;t catch on the fence up there, else old Guthrie will be casting me out of Blawearie for bringing his grey hairs in sorrow to the grave!</i></p>

<p>He said that sneering-like, mocking at father&#8217;s Aberdeenshire voice, and Chris stirred half-angry, and sighed, and then asked <i>What would you do if he did put you out?</i> and Will said <i>Go.&#8212;Would you get a fee?&#8212;Damn the fears of that.</i></p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t sound over-confident, Chris knew right well that he&#8217;d find it none so easy if it came to the push, with the harvest over now in the Howe. And then, for she&#8217;d clean forgot her in the excitement of the fires, she minded the quean Mollie Douglas&#8212;it was as though she saw her white face by Will&#8217;s in the firelit dark: <i>I met Mollie Douglas in Drumlithie to-day, she asked me to ask you to go down and see her.</i></p>

<p>He sat stock-still, he mightn&#8217;t have heard, she pushed at his elbow <i>Will!</i> And at that he shook off her hand, <i>Oh, I hear. What&#8217;s the good? I can&#8217;t have a quean like other folk&#8212;I haven&#8217;t even a fee.&#8212;Maybe she doesn&#8217;t want your fee, just you. Will, they&#8217;re saying things about her and you in Drumlithie&#8212;Galt and coarse tinks like that.&#8212;Saying things? What things?&#8212;What they aye say&#8212;that she&#8217;s with a baby to you and you&#8217;re biding away from her now.&#8212;Galt said that?&#8212;Hinted at it, but he&#8217;ll do more than hint when he&#8217;s not speaking to a sister of yours.</i></p>

<p>She&#8217;d never heard him swear as he did then, jumping to his feet with his fists tight-clenched. <i>That about Mollie&#8212;they said that, the orra swine! I&#8217;ll mash that bloody Galt&#8217;s head till his own mother won&#8217;t know it!</i> But Chris told him that wouldn&#8217;t help much, folk would just snigger and say there was something, sure, in the story of Mollie&#8217;s condition. <i>Then what am I to do?</i> Will asked, raging still, and Chris blushed and said <i>Wait. Do you love her, Will?</i> But she might have known well enough how he&#8217;d take that question, maybe he blushed himself in the lithe of the dark, he threw down the paper torches he&#8217;d saved and muttered <i>I&#8217;m away to Drumlithie,</i> and was running down the hill before she could stop him.</p>

<p>Maybe, as he told Chris later, he went with no other intention than seeing his Mollie herself. But as luck would have it, who should he near run down with his bicycle outside the Drumlithie Hotel but Galt himself, the great creash, gey drunk, and Alec Mutch in his company.</p>

<p>And Alec cried, <i>Fine night, Will,</i> but Galt cried <i>Don&#8217;t take her out to-night, Will lad, the grass is overwet for lying on.</i> Will stopped and jumped off and left his bicycle lying in the road and went up to Galt&#8212;<i>Speaking to me?</i> And the fat creash, panting like a sow in litter and sweating all down the great face of him, hiccoughed drunken-like <i>Who else?&#8212;Well take that then,</i> Will said and let drive at the great belly of Galt; but Mutch caught his arm and cried <i>Young Guthrie, you&#8217;ve fair gone daft, the man&#8217;s old enough to be your father.</i> Will said if he&#8217;d a father like that he&#8217;d kill him and then go and drown himself, and tried to break away from Mutch and get at the Galt creash again. But Galt was right unkeen for that, in a minute he&#8217;d turned, for all his fat, and made off like a hare up the Drumlithie lanes, real swack with his girth and all, and was out of sight in a second.</p>

<p>Well, sure you may be there were claiks enough in Skite for Mutch to get all the story and drive home with it to the Bridge End. In a day or so it was all about the place, Will was the laughing-stock of Kinraddie. Father heard it first from the postman, who waved him down to the road to tell him, and soon&#8217;s he heard it John Guthrie went back to Will stooking in the yavil field and said <i>What&#8217;s this I hear about you and some orra tink bitch in Drumlithie?</i></p>

<p>Now Will had been in a fair fine temper all that day from seeing his Mollie again: and she&#8217;d made him swear he&#8217;d not fly in a rage or go making a fool of himself if he heard their coarse hinting at her. So he just went on with the stooking and said <i>What the devil are you blithering about?</i> Father shot out his beard and cried <i>Answer my question, Will!</i> and Will said <i>Put a question with sense in it, then. How am I to know what you&#8217;ve been hearing? I&#8217;m not a thought-reader,</i> and father said <i>Damn&#8217;t to hell, you coarse brute, am I to stand your lip as well as your whoring every night? Is&#8217;t true there&#8217;s a tink called Mollie Douglas that&#8217;s with a bairn by you?</i> and Will said <i>If you call Mollie Douglas a tink again, I&#8217;ll knock the damned teeth down the throat of you, father though you be.</i></p>

<p>And they stopped their stooking, glaring at each other, and father made to strike at Will but Will caught his arm and cried <i>Mind!</i> So father lowered his arm, white as a ghost he&#8217;d turned, and went on with the stooking. Will stared at him, white himself, and then went on with the stooking as well. And that might well have been the end of it so far as Blawearie went, but that evening they heard a clatter outside in the close and there was the minister&#8217;s bicycle and Mr. Gibbon himself new off it; and into the kitchen he came and said <i>Good evening, Chris, good evening, Mr. Guthrie. Can I have a word with Will?</i></p>

<p>So Chris was sent to bring Will from the byre where he bedded the kye, he came back with her grey in the gills, there sat the minister and father, solemn as two owls in the loft of a barn, it was plain they&#8217;d been taking the matter through hand together. Father said <i>Chris, go to your room,</i> and there was nothing else for her but go; and what happened after that she was never sure, for Will wouldn&#8217;t tell her, but she heard the sound of the three of them, all speaking at once and Will getting in a rage: and then suddenly the kitchen-door banged and there was Will striding across the close to the barn where he stored his bicycle. Mr. Gibbon&#8217;s voice cried after him, angry-like, with a boom, <i>Just a minute, Will, where are you going?</i> and Will looked back and said <i>You&#8217;re so anxious I should lie with my lass and get her with a bairn that I&#8217;m off to try and oblige you.</i> And he wheeled his bicycle out by the honeysuckle hedge and pedalled away down the road and didn&#8217;t come back to Blawearie till one o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Chris hadn&#8217;t been able to sleep, she lay listening for him, and when she heard him come up the stairs she cried his name in a whisper <i>Will!</i> He stopped uncertain outside her door and then lifted the sneck and came in soft-footed and sat on the side of her bed. Chris raised herself on an elbow and peered at him, there was little light in the room and no moon that night though the sky was white with stars, and Will no more than a shadow hunched on her bedside there, with a whitish blotch for a face. And Chris whispered <i>Will, I heard what you said when you went away. But you didn&#8217;t do it?</i> and Will gave a low laugh, he wasn&#8217;t in a rage, <i>It wouldn&#8217;t be for want of prigging by half the holy muckers in Kinraddie if I had. But you needn&#8217;t be feared for that, I&#8217;d as soon cut my own throat as do hurt to&#8212;HER.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the minister&#8217;s interfering brought no harm, faith! he&#8217;d more need to roust round his own bit byre with a clart if Cuddiestoun&#8217;s story of the Gourdon quean were true. And soon enough after that a worse scandal went on the rounds about him, folk shook their heads and made out they were fell affronted: all but Long Rob of the Mill, and he swore B&#8217;God, it was the best he&#8217;d heard since Nebuchadnezzar went out to grass!</p>

<p>And the way of it was that in early November a bit daughter was born to the Manse, and the Reverend Gibbon was proud as punch, he preached a grand sermon that Sunday, <i>For unto us a child is born;</i> and it was so affecting that old Mistress Sinclair of the Netherhill broke down and cried in her hanky about it; but Long Rob of the Mill, when he heard that, said: <i>She shouldn&#8217;t take whisky sweeties to the kirk with her.</i> Everybody else was fell impressed, folk who&#8217;d been a bit off the Manse for months agreed he&#8217;d maybe his faults, the Gibbon childe, but who hadn&#8217;t these days? and feint the many could wag a pow like that in a Mearns pulpit. But damn&#8217;t! if the next day he didn&#8217;t go off and spoil the whole thing, the Monday it was, he was just setting out for the train to Aberdeen, Mr. Gibbon, when the nurse cried out to him he might bring a small chamber-pot for the girlie, none in the Manse was suitable. He gave a bit blush, the big, curly bull, and said <i>Very well, nurse,</i> in a bull-like voice, and off to the station he went, it was Fordoun, and left his bicycle there and caught his train.</p>

<p>About what happened after that some told one thing and some another and some told both together. But it seems that fair early in the day in Aberdeen the Reverend Gibbon fell in with some friends of his; and they&#8217;d have it that a dram there must be to celebrate the occasion. So off the whole lot of them went to a public house and had their dram and syne another on top of that to keep the first one down, syne two-three more to keep the wind out, it was blowy weather on the edge of winter. Some said that midway the carouse Mr. Gibbon had got up to make a bit prayer: and one of the barmaids had laughed at him and he chased her out of the bar up to her room and finished his prayer with her there. But you couldn&#8217;t believe every lie you heard.</p>

<p>Sometime late in the afternoon he minded his train, the minister, and hired a cab and bought the bit chamber, and caught the train by the skin of the teeth. No sooner was he down in his carriage than, fell exhausted, he went fast asleep and blithely snored his way south through many a mile, right dead to the world he was.</p>

<p>Most of the story till then was maybe but guessing, ill-natured guessing at that, but the porter at the Bridge of Dunn, a good twenty miles south from Fordoun, swore to the rest. He was just banging the doors of the old 7.30 when out of a carriage window came a head, like a bull&#8217;s head out of the straw, he&#8217;d fair a turn, had the porter, when he saw the flat hat that topped it. <i>Is this Fordoun?</i> the meikle head mooed, and the porter said <i>No, man, it&#8217;s a damned long way from being that.</i></p>

<p>So he opened the door for Kinraddie&#8217;s minister, and Mr. Gibbon came stumbling out and rubbed his eyes, and the porter pointed to a platform where he&#8217;d find a slow train back to Fordoun. This platform lay over a little bridge and the minister set out to cross; and the first few steps he managed fell well, but near the top he began to sway and missed his footing and flung out his hands. The next thing that the porter saw was the chamber-pot, burst from its paper, rolling down the steps of the bridge with the minister&#8217;s hat in competition and the minister thundering behind.</p>

<p>And then, when the porter had picked him up and was dusting him, the Reverend Gibbon broke down and sobbed on the porter&#8217;s shoulder what a bloody place was Kinraddie! And how&#8217;d the porter like to live &#8216;tween a brier bush and a rotten kailyard in the lee of a house with green shutters? And the minister sobbed some more about the shutters, and he said you couldn&#8217;t lie down a minute with a quean in Kinraddie but that some half-witted clod-hopping crofter began to throw stones at you, they&#8217;d feint the respect for God or kirk or minister down in Kinraddie. And the porter said it was awful the way the world went, he&#8217;d thought of resigning from the railway himself and taking to preaching, but now he wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Syne he helped the minister over to an up-going train and went home to his wife and told her the tale: and she told it to her sister from Auchenblae: and <i>she</i> told it to her man who told it to Mutch; and so the whole thing came out. And next time he rode down by the Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, the minister, a head shot out of a hedge behind him, it was wee Wat Strachan, and cried loud as you like <i>Any chambers to-day?</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that they&#8217;d much to shout for that winter themselves, the Strachans; folk said it was easy to see why Chae was so strong on Rich and Poor being Equal: he was sore in need of the sharing out to start ere he went clean broke himself. Maybe old Sinclair or the wife were tight with the silver that year, but early as December Chae had to sell his corn, he brought the first threshing of the season down in Kinraddie. John Guthrie and Will were off at the keek of dawn when they saw the smoke rise from the engines, Chris followed an hour later to help Chae&#8217;s wife with the dinner and things. And faith! broke he might be but he wasn&#8217;t mean, Chae, when the folk came trampling in to eat there was broth and beef and chicken and oat-cakes, champion cakes they made at the Knapp; and loaf and jelly and dumpling with sugar and milk; and if any soul were that gutsy he wanted more he could hold to the turnip-field, said Chae.</p>

<p>The first three men to come in Chris hardly saw, so busied she was pouring their broth for them. Syne, setting the plates, she saw Alec Mutch, his great lugs like red clouts hung out to dry: and he cried <i>Ay, Chris!</i> and began to sup as though he hadn&#8217;t seen food for a fortnight. Beside him was Munro of the Cuddiestoun, he was eating like a colie ta&#8217;en off its chain, Chae&#8217;s thresh was a spree to the pair of them. Then more trampling and scraping came from the door, folk came drifting in two-three at a time, Chris over-busied to notice their faces, but some watched her and give a bit smile and Cuddiestoun cried to father, <i>Losh, man, she&#8217;s fair an expert getting, the daughter. The kitchen&#8217;s more her style than the College.</i></p>

<p>Some folk at the tables laughed out at that, the ill-nature grinned from the faces of them, and suddenly Chris hated the lot, the English Chris came back in her skin a minute, she saw them the yokels and clowns everlasting, dull-brained and crude. Alec Mutch took up the card from Cuddiestoun then and began on education and the speak ran round the tables. Most said it was a coarse thing, learning, just teaching your children a lot of damned nonsense that put them above themselves, they&#8217;d turn round and give you their lip as soon as look at you.</p>

<p>But Chae was sitting down himself by then and he wouldn&#8217;t have that. <i>Damn&#8217;t man, you&#8217;re clean wrong to think that. Education&#8217;s the thing the working man wants to put him up level with the Rich.</i> And Long Rob of the Mill said <i>I&#8217;d have thought a bit balance in the bank would do that.</i> But for once he seemed right in agreement with Chae&#8212;<i>the more education the more of sense and the less of kirks and ministers.</i> Cuddiestoun and Mutch were fair shocked at that, Cuddiestoun cried out <i>Well, well, we&#8217;ll hear nothing coarse of religion,</i> as though he didn&#8217;t want to hear anything more about it and was giving out orders. But Long Rob wasn&#8217;t a bit took aback, the long rangy childe, he just cocked an eye at Cuddiestoun and cried <i>Well, well, Munro, we&#8217;ll turn to the mentally afflicted in general, not just in particular. How&#8217;s that foreman of yours getting on, Tony? Is he still keeping up with his shorthand?</i> There was a snicker at that, you may well be sure, and Cuddiestoun closed up quick enough, here and there folk had another bit laugh and said Long Rob was an ill hand to counter. And Chris thought of her clowns and yokels, and was shamed as she thought&#8212;Chae and Long Rob they were, the poorest folk in Kinraddie!</p>

<p>At a quarter past six the mill loosed off again from its bumble-bee hum, the threshers came trooping down to the tables again. More dumpling there was, cut up for tea, and bread and butter and scones and baps from the grocer, and rhubarb and blackberry jam, and syrup for them that preferred it, some folk liked to live on dirt out of tins. Most of the mill folk sat down in a right fine tune, well they might, and loosed out their waistcoats. Will was near last to come in from the close, a long, dark young childe came in at his heels, Chris hadn&#8217;t set eyes on him before, nor he on her by the way he glowered. The two of them stood about, lost-like and gowked, looking for seats in the crowded kitchen till Mistress Strachan cried over to Chris <i>Will you lay them places ben in the room?</i></p>

<p>So she did and took them their supper there, Will looked up and cried <i>Hello, Chris, how have you gotten on?</i> and Chris said <i>Fine, how&#8217;ve you?</i> Will laughed <i>Well, God, my back would feel a damned sight easier if I&#8217;d spent the day in my bed. Eh, Tavendale?</i> And then he minded his manners. <i>This is Ewan Tavendale from Upprums, Chris.</i></p>

<p>So that was who; Chris felt queer as he raised his head and held out his hand, and she felt the blood come in her face and saw it come dark in his. He looked over young for the coarse, dour brute folk said he was, like a wild cat, strong and quick, she half-liked his face and half-hated it, it could surely never have been him that did THAT in the larch wood of Upperhill? But then if you could read every childe&#8217;s nature in the way he wiped his nose, said Long Rob of the Mill, it would be a fine and easy world to go through.</p>

<p>So she paid him no more heed and was out of the Knapp a minute later and ran nearly all the way up to Blawearie to see to the milking there. The wind was still up but the frost was crackling below her feet as she ran, the brae rose cold and uncanny with Blawearie&#8217;s biggings uncertain shadows high up in the cold mirk there. She felt tingling and blithe from her run, she said to herself if she&#8217;d only the time she&#8217;d go out every winter night and run up over hills with frost and the night star coming in the sky.</p>

<p>But that night as Blawearie went to its bed Will opened his bedroom door and cried <i>Father! Chris! See that light down there in the Knapp!</i></p>

<p>Chris was over at her window then in a minute, barefooted she ran and peered by the shadow of the great beech tree. And there was a light right plain enough, more than a light, a lowe that crackled to yellow and red and rose in the wind that had come with the night. Peesie&#8217;s Knapp would be all in a blaze in a minute, Chris knew; and then father came tearing down the stairs, crying to Will to get on his clothes and follow him, Chris was to bide at home, mind that. They heard him open the front door and go out and go running right fleetly down the night of Blawearie hill, Chris cried to Will <i>Wait for me, I&#8217;m coming as well,</i> and he cried back <i>All right, but for God&#8217;s sake hurry!</i></p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t find her stockings then, she was trembling and daft; and when found they were, her corsets were missing, slipped down the back of the kist they had, Will came knocking at the door <i>Come on!&#8212;Light a match and come in,</i> she called and in he came, knotting his muffler, and lighted a match and looked at her in her knickers and vest, reaching out for the new-seen corsets. <i>Leave the damn things where they are, you&#8217;re fine, you should never have been born a quean.</i> She was into her skirt by then, and said <i>I wish I hadn&#8217;t,</i> and pulled on her boots and half-laced them, and ran down the stairs after Will and put on her coat at the foot.</p>

<p>In a minute they were out in the dimness then, under the starlight, it was rimed with frost, and running like mad down to the lowe that now rose like a beacon against the whole of Kinraddie. <i>I hope they&#8217;ve wakened!</i> Will panted, for every soul knew the Strachans went straight to bed at the chap of eight. Running, they could see by then it was the barn itself that had taken alight, the straw sow seemed burned to a cinder already, and the barn had caught and maybe the house. And all over Kinraddie lights were springing up, as they ran Chris lifted her eyes and saw Cuddiestoun&#8217;s blink and shine bright down through the dark.</p>

<p>And faith, quick though they were, it was father that saved Chae Strachan&#8217;s folk. He was first down at the blazing Knapp, John Guthrie; and he ran round the biggings and saw the flames lapping and lowing at the kitchen end of the house, not a soul about or trying to stop them though the noise was fair awful, the crackling and burning, and the winter air bright with flying sticks and straw. He banged at the door and cried <i>Damn&#8217;t to hell do you want to be roasted?</i> and when he got no answer he smashed in the window, they heard him then and the bairns scraiched, there was never such a lot for sleep, folk said, Chae&#8217;d have slept himself out of this world and into hell in his own firewood if John Guthrie hadn&#8217;t roused him then. But out he came stumbling at last, he&#8217;d only his breeks on; and he took a keek at John Guthrie and another at the fire and cried out <i>Kirsty, we&#8217;re all to hell!</i> and off he tore to the byre.</p>

<p>But half-way across the close as he ran the barn swithered and roared and fell, right in front of him, and he&#8217;d to run back, there was no way then of getting at the byre. By then Long Rob of the Mill came in about, he&#8217;d run over the fields, louping dykes like a hare, and his lungs were panting like bellows, he was clean winded. He it was that helped Mrs. Strachan with the bairns and such clothes as they could drag out to the road while Chae and John Guthrie tried to get at the byre from another angle: but that was no good, the place was already roaring alight.</p>

<p>For a while there was only the snarling of the fire eating into the wooden couplings, the rattle of falling slates through the old charred beams, and then, the first sound that Will and Chris heard as they came panting down the road, a scream that was awful, a scream that made them think one of the Strachans was trapped down there. And at that sound Chae covered his ears and cried <i>Oh God, that&#8217;s old Clytie,</i> Clytie was his little horse, his sholtie, and she screamed and screamed, terrible and terrible, Chris ran back to the house trying not to hear and to help poor Kirsty Strachan, snivelling and weeping, and the bairns laughing and dancing about as though they were at a picnic, and Long Rob of the Mill smoking his pipe as cool as you please, there was surely enough smell and smoke without that? But pipe and all he dived in and out of the house and saved chairs and dishes and baskets of eggs; and Mistress Strachan cried <i>Oh, my sampler!</i> and in Rob tore and rived that off a blazing wall, a meikle worsted thing in a cracked glass case that Mistress Strachan had made as a bairn at school.</p>

<p>And then came the clip-clop of a gig, it was Ellison down from the Mains, him and two of his men, and God! he might be little more than a windy Irish brute but he&#8217;d sense for all that, the gig was crammed with ropes and pails, Ellison strung out the folk and took charge, the pails went swinging from hand to hand over the close from the well to the childe that stood nearest the fire, and he pelted the fire with water. But feint the much good that did for a while and then there was an awful sound from the byre, the lowing of the cattle with the flames among them, and Long Rob of the Mill cried out <i>I can&#8217;t stand it!</i> and took a pick-axe and ran round the back of the close; and there he found the sow was nothing but a black heap then, hardly burning at all, and he cried back the news and himself louped through the smoke and came at the back wall of the byre and started to smash it in fast as he could.</p>

<p>Chae followed and John Guthrie, and the three of them worked like madmen there, Ellison&#8217;s men splashed water down on the roof above them till suddenly the wall gave way before them and Chae&#8217;s oldest cow stuck out its head and said <i>Moo!</i> right in Chae&#8217;s face. The three scrambled through into the byre then, that was fell dangerous, the rafters were crumbling and falling all about the stalls, and it was half-dark there in spite of the flames. But they loosed another cow and two stirks before the fire drove them out, the others they had to leave, their lowing was fair demented and the smell of their burning sickening in your throat, it was nearly a quarter of an hour later before the roof fell in and killed the cattle. Long Rob of the Mill sat down by the side of the road and was suddenly as sick as could be, and he said <i>By God, I never want to smell roasting beef again.</i></p>

<p>So that was the burning of the Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, there was a great throng of folk in about by then, the Netherhill folk and the Upperhill, and Cuddiestoun, and Alec Mutch with his great lugs lit up by the fire, some had come on bicycles and some had run across half Kinraddie and two had brought their gigs. But there was little to do now but stand and glower at the fire and its mischief. Ellison drove off to the Mains with Mistress Strachan and the bairns, there for the night they were bedded. The cattle he&#8217;d saved from the byre Chae drove to Netherhill, folk began to put on their jackets again, it was little use waiting for anything else, they&#8217;d away home to their beds.</p>

<p>Chris could see nothing of either father or Will, she turned to make for Blawearie then. Outside the radiance of the burning Knapp it was hard and cold, starless but clear, as though the steel of the ground glowed faintly of itself; beyond rose the darkness as a black wall, still and opaque. On the verge of its embrasure it was that she nearly ran into two men tramping back along the road, she hardly saw them till she was on them. She cried <i>Oh, I&#8217;m sorry,</i> and one of them laughed and said something to the other, next instant before she knew what was happening that other had her in his arms, rough and strong, and had kissed her, he had a face with a soft, grained skin, it was the first time a man had ever kissed her like that, dark and frightening and terrible in the winter road.</p>

<p>The other stood by, Chris, paralysed, heard him breathing and knew he was laughing, and a far crackle rose from the last of the lowe in the burning biggings. Then she came to herself and kicked the man that held her, young he was with his soft, grained face, kicked him hard with her knee and then brought her nails down across his face. As he swore <i>You bitch!</i> and let go of her she kicked him again, with her foot this time, and he swore again, but the other said <i>Hist! Here&#8217;s somebody coming,</i> and the two of them began to run, the cowardly tinks, it was father and Will on the road behind them.</p>

<p>And when Chris told Will of what happened, next morning it was that she told him when father wasn&#8217;t by, he looked at her queerly, half-laughing, half-solemn, and made out he thought nothing of the happening, all ploughmen were like that, aye ready for fun. But it hadn&#8217;t seemed fun to her, dead earnest rather; and lying that night in her bed between the cold sheets, curled up so that she might rub her white toes to some warmth and ease, it was in her memory like being chased and bitten by a beast, but worse and with something else in it, as though half she&#8217;d liked the beast and the biting and the smell of that sleeve around her neck and that soft, unshaven face against her own. Sweet breath he had had anyway, she thought, and laughed to herself, that was some consolation, the tink. And then she fell asleep and dreamed of him, an awful dream that made her blush even while she knew she was dreaming, she was glad when the morning came and was sane and cool and herself again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that dream came to her often while the winter wore on through Kinraddie, a winter that brought hardly any snow till New Year&#8217;s Eve and then brought plenty darkening the sky with its white cascading. It was funny that darkening the blind fall and wheep of the snow should bring, like the loosening of a feather pillow above the hills, night came as early as three in the afternoon. They redd up the beasts early that evening, father and Will, feeding them well with turnips and straw and hot treacle poured on the straw, and then they came in to their supper and had it and sat close round the fire while Chris made a fine dumpling for New Year&#8217;s Day. None of them spoke for long, listening to that whoom and blatter on the window-panes, and the clap-clap-clap of some loose slate far up on the roof, till father whispered and looked at them, his whisper hurt worse than a shout, <i>God, I wonder why Jean left us?</i></p>

<p>Chris cried then, making no sound, she looked at Will and saw him with his face red and shamed, all three of them thinking of mother, her that was by them so kind and friendly and quick that last New Year, so cold and quiet and forgotten now with the little dead twins in the kirkyard of Kinraddie, piling black with the driving of the snow it would be under the rustle and swing and creak of the yews. And Will stared at father, his face was blind with pity, once he made to speak, but couldn&#8217;t, always they&#8217;d hated one the other so much and they&#8217;d feel shamed if they spoke in friendship now.</p>

<p>So father took up his paper again and at ten o&#8217;clock Chris went out to milk the kye and Will went with her over the close, carrying the lantern, the flame of it leapt and starred and quivered and hesitated in the drive of the snow. In the light of it, like a rain of arrows they saw the coming of the storm that night swept down from the Grampian heuchs, thick and strong it was in Blawearie, but high in the real hills a smoring, straight wall must be sweeping the dark, blinding down against the lone huts of the shepherds and the faces of lost tinks tramping through it looking for lights the snow&#8217;d smothered long before. Chris was shaking, but not with cold, and inside the byre she leant on a stall and Will said <i>God, you look awful, what is&#8217;t?</i> And she shook herself and said <i>Nothing. Why haven&#8217;t you gone to see Mollie to-night?</i></p>

<p>He said he was going next day, wasn&#8217;t that enough, he&#8217;d be a corpse long ere he reached Drumlithie to-night&#8212;<i>listen to the wind, it&#8217;ll blow the damn place down on our lugs in a minute!</i> And the byre shook, between the lulls it seemed to set its breath to rise and take from the hill-side into the air, there was such straining and creaking. Not that the calves or the stirks paid heed, they slept and snored in their stalls with never a care, there were worse things in the world than being a beast.</p>

<p>Back in the house it seemed to Chris she&#8217;d but hardly sieved the milk when the great clock ben in the parlour sent peal after peal out dirling through the place. Will looked at Chris and the two at father, and John Guthrie was just raising up his head from his paper, but if he&#8217;d been to wish them a happy New Year or not they were never to know, for right at that minute there came a brisk chap at the door and somebody lifted the sneck and stamped the snow from his feet and banged the door behind him.</p>

<p>And there he was, Long Rob of the Mill, muffled in a great grey cravat and with leggings up to the knees, covered and frosted from head to foot in the snow, he cried <i>Happy New Year to you all! Am I the first?</i> And John Guthrie was up on his feet, <i>Ay, man, you&#8217;re fairly that, out of that coat of yours!</i> They stripped off the coat between them, faith! Rob&#8217;s mouser was nearly frozen, but he said it was fine and laughed, and waited the glass of toddy father brought him and cried <i>Your health!</i> And just as it went down his throat there came a new knock, damn&#8217;t if it wasn&#8217;t Chae Strachan, he&#8217;d had more than a drink already and he cried <i>Happy New Year, I&#8217;m the first foot in am I not?</i> And he made to kiss Chris, she wouldn&#8217;t have minded, laughing, but he slithered and couped on the floor. Long Rob peered down at him and cried out, shocked-like, <i>Good God, Chae, you can&#8217;t sleep there!</i></p>

<p>So he was hoisted into a chair and was better in a minute when he&#8217;d had another drink; and he began to tell what a hell of a life it was he&#8217;d to live in Netherhill now, the old mistress grew worse with the years, she&#8217;d near girn the jaws from her face if the Strachan bairns so much as gave a bit howl or had a bit fight&#8212;fell unreasoning that, no bairns there were but fought like tinks. And Long Rob said Ay, that was true, as it said in the hymn &#8216;twas dog&#8217;s delight to bark and bite, and faith! the average human could out-dog any cur that ever was pupped.</p>

<p>Now, horses were different, you&#8217;d hardly ever meet a horse that was naturally a quarreller, a coarse horse was a beast they&#8217;d broken in badly. He&#8217;d once had a horse&#8212;a three-four years come Martinmas that would have been, or no! man, it was only two&#8212;that he bought up in Auchinblae at the fall of the year, a big roan, coarse as hell, they said, and he&#8217;d nearly kicked the guts out of an old man there. Well, Rob had borrowed a bridle and tried to ride home the beast to the Mill, and twice in the first mile the horse threw him off with a snort and stood still, just laughing, as Rob picked himself up from the stour. But Rob just said to himself, <i>All right, my mannie, we&#8217;ll see who&#8217;ll laugh last;</i> and when he&#8217;d got that horse home he tied him up in his stall and gave him such a hammering, by God he nearly kicked down the stable.</p>

<p>Every night for a week he was walloped like that, and damn&#8217;t man! in the shortest while he&#8217;d quietened down and turned into a real good worker, near human he was, that horse, he&#8217;d turn at the end of a rig as it drew to eleven o&#8217;clock and begin to nicker and neigh, he knew the time fine. Ay, canty beast that, he&#8217;d turned, and sold at a profit in a year or so, it just showed you what a handless man did with a horse, for Rob had heard that the beast&#8217;s new owner had let the horse clean go over him. A sound bit leathering and a pinch of kindness was the only way to cure a coarse horse.</p>

<p>Chae hiccuped and said <i>Damn&#8217;t ay, man, maybe you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s a pity old Sinclair never thought of treating his fish-wife like that, she&#8217;d deave a door-nail with her whines and plaints, the thrawn old Tory bitch.</i> And Long Rob said there were worse folk than Tories and Chae said if there were they kept themselves damn close hidden, if he&#8217;d his way he&#8217;d have all Tories nailed up in barrels full of spikes and rolled down the side of the Grampians; and Long Rob said there would be a gey boom in the barrel trade then, the most of Kinraddie would be inside the barrels; and Chae said <i>And a damned good riddance of rubbish, too.</i></p>

<p>They were both heated up with the toddy then, and raising their voices, but father just said, cool-like, that he was a Liberal himself, and what did they think of this bye-election coming off in the February? Chae said it would make no difference who got in, one tink robber was bad as another, Tory as Liberal; damn&#8217;t if he understood why Blawearie should be taken in by those Liberals. Long Rob said <i>Why don&#8217;t you stand as the Socialist man yourself, Chae?</i> and winked at Chris, but Chae took it real serious and said maybe he&#8217;d do that yet once Peesie&#8217;s Knapp was builded again. And Long Rob said <i>Why wait for that? You&#8217;re allowing your opinions to eat their heads off in idleness, like a horse in a stall in winter. Losh, man, but they&#8217;re queer beasts, horses. There&#8217;s my sholtie, Kate</i>&#8212;But Chae said <i>Och, away to hell with your horses, Rob. Damn&#8217;t, if you want a canty kind of beast there&#8217;s nothing like a camel,</i> and maybe he&#8217;d have just begun to tell them about the camel if he hadn&#8217;t fallen off his chair then, nearly into the fire he went, and John Guthrie smiled at him over his beard, as though he&#8217;d really rather cut his throat than smile. And then Will and Long Rob helped Chae to his feet, Long Rob gave a laugh and said it was time they went dandering back to their beds, he&#8217;d see Chae far as the Netherhill.</p>

<p>The storm had cleared a bit by then, it was bright starlight Chris saw looking after the figures of the two from her bedroom window&#8212;not very steady, either of them, with shrouded Kinraddie lying below and a smudge there, faint and dark, far down in the night, that was the burned-out steading of Peesie&#8217;s Knapp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And there the smudge glimmered through many a week, they didn&#8217;t start on Peesie&#8217;s new steading till well in the February. But faith! there was clatter enough of tongues round the place right from the night of the fire onwards. All kinds of folk came down and poked in the ash with their walking-sticks, the police and the Cruelty came from Stone haven; and the factor came, he was seldom seen unless there was money in question; and insurance creatures buzzed down from Aberdeen like a swarm of fleas, their humming and hawing and gabbling were the speak of all Kinraddie.</p>

<p>Soon all kinds of stories flew up and down the Howe, some said the fire had been lighted by Chae himself, a Drumlithie billy riding by the Knapp late that night of the fire had seen Chae with a box of spunks in his hand, coming from the lighting of the straw sow, sure; for soon as he saw the billy on the bicycle back Chae had jumped to the lithe again. Others said the fire had been set by the folk of Netherhill, their only chance of recovering the silver they&#8217;d loaned to Chae. But that was just a plain lie, like the others, Chris thought, Chae&#8217;d have never cried for his burning sholtie like that if he&#8217;d meant it to burn for insurance.</p>

<p>But stories or no, they couldn&#8217;t shake Chae, he was paid his claims up to the hilt, folk said he&#8217;d made two-three hundred pounds on the business, he&#8217;d be less keen now for Equality. But faith! if he&#8217;d won queer silver queerly, he&#8217;d lost feint the queer notion in the winning of it.</p>

<p>Just as the building of the new bit Knapp began so did the bye-election, the old member had died in London of drink, poor brute, folk said when they cut his corpse open it fair gushed out with whisky. Ah well, he was dead then, him and his whisky, and though he&#8217;d maybe been a good enough childe to represent the shire, feint the thing had the shire ever seen of him except at election times. Now there came a young Tory gent in the field, called Rose he was, an Englishman with a funny bit squeak of a voice, like a bairn that&#8217;s wet its breeks. But the Liberal was an oldish creature from Glasgow, fell rich he was, folk said, with as many ships to his name as others had fields. And real Radical he was, with everybody&#8217;s money but his own, and he said he&#8217;d support the Insurance and to Hell with the House of Lords, <i>Vote for the Scottish Thistle and not for the English Rose.</i></p>

<p>But the Tory said the House of Lords had aye been defenders of the Common People, only he didn&#8217;t say aye, his English was a real drawback; and it was at the meeting where he said that, that Chae Strachan up and asked if it wasn&#8217;t true that his own uncle was a lord? And the Tory said <i>Yes,</i> and Chae said that maybe <i>that</i> lord would be glad to see him in Parliament but there was a greater Lord who heard when the Tories took the name of poor folk in vain. The God of old Scotland there was, aye fighting on the side of the people since the days of old John Knox, and He would yet bring to an end the day of wealth and waster throughout the world, liberty and equality and fraternity were coming though all the damned lordies in the House of Lords should pawn their bit coronets and throw their whores back in the streets and raise private armies to fight the common folk with their savings.</p>

<p>But then the stewards made at Chae, he hadn&#8217;t near finished, and an awful stamash broke out in the hall; for though most of the folk had been laughing at Chae they weren&#8217;t to see him mishandled by an English tink and the coarse fisher brutes he&#8217;d hired from Gourdon; to keep folk from asking him questions. So when the first steward laid hands on Chae, John Guthrie, who was sitting near, cried <i>Ay, man, who&#8217;ll you be?</i> And the fisher swore <i>You keep quiet as well,</i> and father rose and took him a belt in the face, and the fisher&#8217;s nose bled like the Don in spate, and somebody put out a leg and tripped him up and that was the end of his stewarding. And when the other steward made to come to his help Long Rob of the Mill said <i>Away home to your stinking fish!</i> and took him by the lug and ran him out of the hall and kicked him into the grass outside.</p>

<p>Then everybody was speaking at once, Mr. Gibbon was the Tory lad&#8217;s chairman and he called out <i>Can&#8217;t you give us fair play, Charles Strachan?</i> But Chae&#8217;s blood was up, strong for the Kirk though he was in a way he clean forgot who he spoke to&#8212;<i>Come outside a minute, my mannie, and I&#8217;ll fair-play you!</i> The minister wasn&#8217;t such a fool as that, though, he said that the meeting was closed, fair useless it was to go on; and he said that Chae was a demagogue and Chae said that he was a liar, folk cried out <i>Wheest, wheest!</i> at that and begun to go home. The Tory childe got hantle few votes in the end, Chae boasted it was his help put in the old Liberal stock; and God knows if he thought that fine he was easily pleased, they never saw the creature again in Kinraddie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that was the last time father struck a man, striking in cold anger and cold blood as was the way of him. Folk said he was an unchancy child to set in a rage; but his next rage mischieved himself, not others. For a while up into the New Year, April and the turnip-time, things at Blawearie went fair and smooth, Will saying no more than his say at plate or park, never countering father, hardly he looked at him even; and father maybe thought to rule the roost as he&#8217;d done before when Will was no more than a boy that cowered when he heard that sharp voice raised, frightened and beaten and lying through nights with his sore wealed body in the arms of Chris. But Chris, knowing none of his plannings, guessed right well something new it was kept Will quiet, so quiet day on day, yet if you looked at him sudden you&#8217;d more likely than not seeing him smiling to himself, lovely the face that he smiled with, brown and clean, and his eyes were kind and clear and the hair grew down on his head in a bonny mop, Will took after mother with that flame of rusty gold that was hers.</p>

<p>Ah well, he kept to his whistling and his secret smiling, and every night after loosening and suppering was done, off down the road on his old bit bicycle he&#8217;d go, you&#8217;d hear through the evening stillness nothing but the sound of the old machine whirring down Blawearie road, and the weet-weet of the peewits flying twilit over Kinraddie, wheeling and circling there in the dark, daft creatures that made their nests in this rig and that and would come back next day and find them robbed or smothered away. So for hundreds of years they&#8217;d done, the peewits, said Long Rob of the Mill, and hadn&#8217;t learned the sense of the thing even yet; and if you were to take that as a sample of the Divine Intelligence that had allotted a fitting amount of brain to each creature&#8217;s needs then all you could suppose was that the Divine had more than a spite against the peesie.</p>

<p>Chris heard him say that one day she looked in at the Mill to ask when a sack of bruised corn, left there by Will, would be ready. But there on the bench outside the Mill, in the shade from the hot Spring weather, sat Rob and Chae and Mutch of Bridge End, all guzzling beer from long bottles they were, Rob more bent on bruising their arguments than on bruising Blawearie&#8217;s corn.</p>

<p>Peewits were flying round the Mill fell thick, peewits and crows that nested in the pines above the Mill, and the birds it was had begun the argument. Chris waited for a while, pleased enough with the shade and rest, hearkening to Long Rob make a fool of God. But Alec Mutch wagged his meikle lugs, <i>No, man, you&#8217;re fair wrong there. And man, Rob, you&#8217;ll burn in hell for that, you know.</i> Chae was half on his side and half wasn&#8217;t, he said <i>Damn the fears, that&#8217;s nothing but an old wife&#8217;s gabble for fearing the bairns. But Something there IS up there, Rob man, there&#8217;s no denying that. If I thought there wasn&#8217;t I&#8217;d out and cut my throat this minute.</i> Then the three of them sighted Chris and Rob got up, the long, rangy childe with the glinting eyes, and cried <i>Is&#8217;t about the bruised corn, Chris? Tell Will I&#8217;ll do it to-night.</i></p>

<p>But Will had unyoked and made off to Drumlithie, his usual gait, when Chris got home, and father was up on the moor with his gun, you heard the bang of the shots come now and then. Chris had a great baking to do that night, both father and Will would eat oatcakes and scones for a wager, bought bread from the vans soon scunnered them sore. Warm work it was when you&#8217;d heaped a great fire and the girdle glowed below, you&#8217;d nearly to strip in fine weather if you weren&#8217;t to sweat yourself sick. Chris got out of most things but a vest and a petticoat, she was all alone and could do as she pleased, it was fine and free and she baked with a will.</p>

<p>She was lifting the last cake, browned and good and twice cross cut, when she knew that somebody watched her from the door of the kitchen, and she looked, it was Ewan Tavendale, him she hadn&#8217;t seen since the day of the thresh at Peesie&#8217;s Knapp. He was standing against the jamb, long and dark with his glowering eyes, but he reddened when she looked, not half as much as she did herself, she could feel the red warm blushing come through her skin from tip to toe; <i>such a look he&#8217;s taking,</i> she thought, <i>it&#8217;s a pity I&#8217;m wearing a thing and he can&#8217;t study the blush to its end.</i></p>

<p>But he just said <i>Hello, is Will about?</i> and Chris said <i>No, in Drumlithie I think,</i> and they stood and glowered like a couple of gowks, Chris saw his eyes queer and soft and shy, the neck of his shirt had fallen apart, below it the skin was white as new milk, frothed white it looked, and a drop of sweat stood there where the brown of his tanning and the white of his real skin met. And then Chris suddenly knew <i>something</i> and blushed again, sharp and silly, she couldn&#8217;t stop, she&#8217;d minded the night of the fire at Peesie&#8217;s Knapp and the man that had kissed her on the homeward road, Ewan Tavendale it had been, no other, shameless and coarse.</p>

<p>He was blushing himself again by then, they looked at each other in a white, queer daze, Chris wondered in a kind of a panic if he knew what she knew at last, half-praying she was he wouldn&#8217;t speak of it when he began to move off from the door, still red, stepping softly, like father, like a limber, soft-stepping cat. <i>Well, I was hoping I&#8217;d see him in case he should leave us suddenlike.</i></p>

<p>She stared at him all awake, that kissing on the winter road forgotten. <i>Leave? Who said Will was leaving?&#8212;Oh, I heard he was trying for a job in Aberdeen, maybe it&#8217;s a lie. Tell him I called in about. Ta-ta.</i></p>

<p>She called <i>Ta-ta, Ewan,</i> after him as he crossed the close, he half-turned round and smiled at her, quick and dark like a cat again, <i>Ta-ta, Chris.</i> And she stood looking after him a long while, not thinking, smiling, till the smell of a burning cake roused her to run, just like the English creature Alfred.</p>

<p>And next morning she said to Will after breakfast, casual-like, but her heart in her throat, <i>Ewan Tavendale was down to see you last night, he thought you&#8217;d be leaving Blawearie soon.</i> And Will took it cool and quiet, <i>Did he? God, they&#8217;d haver the breeks from a Highlandman&#8217;s haunches, the gossipers of Kinraddie. Tavendale down to see me? More likely he was down to take a bit keek at you, Chris lass. So look after yourself, for he&#8217;s Highland and coarse.</i></p>

<p>In July it came to the hay-time, and John Guthrie looked at Will and said he was going to have down the hay with a scythe this year, not spoil the bit stuff with a mower. Fair plain to Chris he expected Will to fly in a rage at that and say he wasn&#8217;t to chave and sweat in the forking of rig after rig when a mower would clear Blawearie&#8217;s park in a day or two at the most. But Will just said <i>All right</i> and went on with his porridge, and went out to the field in the tail of father, a fork on his shoulder and whistling happy as a lark, so that father turned round and snapped <i>Hold your damned wheeber, you&#8217;ll need your breath for the bout.</i> Even at that Will laughed, as a man at a girning bairn, right off they were worse friends than even the year before. But all that time, Will was making his plans and on the morning of the August&#8217;s last Saturday, Chris aye remembered that morning with its red sun and the singing of the North Sea over the Howe, that morning he said to father <i>I&#8217;m off to Aberdeen to-day.</i></p>

<p>Father said never a word, he went on with his porridge and finished it, he mightn&#8217;t have heard Will speak, he lighted his pipe and stepped out of the house, fleet as ever he went, and began coling the hayfield in front of the house; Will could see him then and be shamed of himself and his idle jaunting. But Will wasn&#8217;t ashamed, he looked after father with a sneer, <i>The old fool thinks he can frighten me still,</i> and said something else Chris didn&#8217;t catch, syne looked at her suddenly, his eyes bright and his lips moving, <i>Chris&#8212;Lord, I wish you were coming as well!</i></p>

<p>She stared at that amazed, pleased as well. <i>What, up to Aberdeen? I&#8217;d like it fine but I can&#8217;t. Hurry and dress else you&#8217;ll miss your train.</i></p>

<p>So he went and dressed, fell slow-like he seemed at the business, she thought, the morning and a jaunt in front of him. She went to the foot of the stairs and cried up to ask if he were having a sleep before he set out? And instead of answering her back with a jest and a fleer he laughed a shaky laugh and called out All right, he&#8217;d soon be down. And when he came she saw him in his Sunday suit, with his new boots shining, he&#8217;d on a new hat that suited him fine. <i>Well, will I do?</i> he asked and Chris said <i>You look fair brave,</i> and he said <i>Havers!</i> and picked up his waterproof, <i>Well, ta-ta, Chris;</i> and suddenly turned round to her and she saw his face red and strange and he kissed her, they hadn&#8217;t kissed since they were children lying in a bed together on a frosty night.</p>

<p>She wiped her mouth, feeling shamed and pleased, and pushed him away, he tried to speak, and couldn&#8217;t, and said <i>Oh, to hell!</i> and turned and ran out of the door, she saw him go down the Blawearie road fast as he could walk, looking up at the hills he was with the sun on them and the slow fog rising off the Howe, jerking his head this way and that, fast though he walked, but he didn&#8217;t once look in father&#8217;s direction nor father at him. Syne she heard him whistling bonny and clear, <i>Up in the Morning,</i> it was, they&#8217;d used that for a signal in the days when they went the school-road together, and down on the turnpike edge he looked round and stood still, and waved his hand, he knew she was watching. Then a queer kind of pain came into her throat, her eyes smarted and she told herself she was daft, Will was only off for the day, he&#8217;d be back at night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Will didn&#8217;t come back that night, he didn&#8217;t come back the next day, he came back never again to John Guthrie&#8217;s Kinraddie. For up in Aberdeen he was wed to his Mollie Douglas, he&#8217;d altered his birth certificate for that; and the earth might have opened and swallowed them up after that, it seemed not a soul in Aberdeen had seen them go. So when father went into Aberdeen on the track of the two there wasn&#8217;t a trace to be found, he went to the police and raged at them, but they only laughed&#8212;had he lain with the quean himself, maybe, that so mad he was with this son of his?</p>

<p>So father came home, fair bursting with rage, but that didn&#8217;t help. And ten days went by before they heard of the couple again, it came in a letter Will sent to Chris at Blawearie; and it told that through Mollie&#8217;s mother, old Mistress Douglas, Will had got him a job in the Argentine, cattleman there on a big Polled Angus ranch, and he and Mollie were sailing from Southampton the day he wrote; and oh! he wished Chris could have seen them married; and remember them kindly, they would write again, and Mrs. Douglas at Drumlithie would aye be a friend to her.</p>

<p>So that was Will&#8217;s going, it was fair the speak of the parish a while, folk laughed at father behind his back and said maybe that would bring down his pride a bit; and they asked Chae Strachan, that well-travelled childe, where was this Argentine, was it a fine place, would you say? And Chae said <i>Och,</i> fine, he&#8217;d never been actually there, you might say, but a gey fine place it was, no doubt, a lot of silver was there; and <i>Damn&#8217;t man, young Guthrie&#8217;s no fool to spread his bit wings, I was just the same myself.</i> But most said it was fair shameful of Will to go off and leave his father like that, black burning shame he might think of himself; it just showed you what the world was coming to, you brought bairns into the world and reared them up and expected some comfort from them in your old age and what did you get? Nothing but a lot of damned impudence, it was all this education and dirt. You might well depend on it, that coarse young Guthrie brute would never thrive, there&#8217;d be a judgment on him, you&#8217;d see, him and his coarse tink quean.</p>

<p>Judgment or not on Will, it was hardly a week before his own rage struck down John Guthrie. He&#8217;d been setting up ricks in the cornyard when Chris heard a frightened squawk break out from the hens. She thought maybe some strange dog was among them and caught up a spurtle and ran out to the close and there saw father lying still in his blood, black blood it looked on his face where he&#8217;d fallen and mischieved himself against a stone.</p>

<p>She cried out to him in fright and then cooled herself down, and ran for water from the spring and dipped her hanky in it and bathed his face. He opened his eyes then, dazed-like he seemed, and he said <i>All right, Jean lass,</i> and tried to rise, and couldn&#8217;t. And rage came on him again, he put out his hand and gave Chris a push that near threw her down, he tried and tried to rise up, it was sickening to see. He chaved on the ground as though something tied him there, all one of his sides and legs, and the blood veins stood out blue on his face; and he cursed and said <i>Get into the house, you white-faced bitch!</i> he wouldn&#8217;t have her looking at him. So she watched from behind the door, near sick she felt, it was as though a great frog were squattering there in the stour, and the hens gathered and squawked about him.</p>

<p>And at last he stood up and staggered to a stone, and Chris didn&#8217;t look more, going on with her work as well as she could with hands that quivered and quivered. But when he came in for supper he looked much as ever, and grumbled at this and that, and ate his egg as though it would do him ill, syne got his gun and went off to the hill as fleet as ever.</p>

<p>He was long up there, Chris went to the window and watched for him, seeing the August late night close in, Cuddiestoun&#8217;s sheep were baaing high up in the Cuddiestoun moor and a sprig of the honeysuckle that made the Blawearie hedges so bonny through the summer tapped and touched against the window-pane, it was like a slow hand tapping there; and the evening was quiet in the blow of the night-wind, and no sign of father till Chris grew alarmed and nearly went out to look for him. But then she heard his step in the porch, in he came and put down his gun and saw her stand there and cried out <i>Damn&#8217;t to hell, is that all you&#8217;ve to do, stand about like a lady?</i> So you could hardly believe there was much wrong with him then, except ill-nature, he&#8217;d plenty of that, you&#8217;d no foreseeing that next morning he&#8217;d try to get out of bed and lie paralysed.</p>

<p>She wouldn&#8217;t in a hurry forget the sight of him then, nor the run she had down Blawearie brae till the new Knapp came in sight, brave with its biggings and house. But there at last was Chae Strachan, he was busied letting a strainer into the ground, smoking, the blue smoke of his pipe rose into the air, blue, like a pencil-stroke, a cock was crowing across the Denburn and he didn&#8217;t hear her cry for a while. But then he did and was quick enough, he ran up to meet her, <i>What&#8217;s wrong, Chris lass?</i> and she told him and he turned and ran down&#8212;<i>Go back to your father and I&#8217;ll get to the doctor myself and send the wife up to Blawearie.</i></p>

<p>And up she came, the fat, fusionless creature, all she could do was to stand and gowk at father, <i>Mighty me, Mr. Guthrie, this is a sore, sore sight, whatever will you do now, eh?</i> And father mouthed and mowed at her from the bed as though the first thing he&#8217;d be keen on doing was braining her, paralysis or not he&#8217;d still plenty of rage. For when the doctor came up at last from Bervie and bustled into the room, peering and poking with the sharp, quick face of him, and his bald head shining, and snapped in his curt-like way, <i>What&#8217;s this? what&#8217;s wrong with you now, Blawearie?</i> father managed to speak out then right enough&#8212;<i>That&#8217;s for you to find out, what the hell do you think you&#8217;re paid for?</i></p>

<p>So the doctor grinned behind his hand, <i>One of you women must help me strip him.</i> And he looked from Kirsty to Chris and said <i>You, Chris lass,</i> and that she did while Mrs. Strachan went down to the kitchen to make him tea and trail around like a clucking hen, God! what might be happening in Peesie&#8217;s Knapp without her? Chris lost her temper at last, she lost it seldom enough, this time it went with a bang&#8212;<i>I don&#8217;t know either what&#8217;s happening in Peesie&#8217;s Knapp but if you&#8217;re in such tune about it you&#8217;d better go home and find out.</i> Mrs. Strachan reddened up at that, bubbling like a hubbley-jock, that wasn&#8217;t the way for a quean to speak to a woman that might well be her mother, she might think shame to curse and swear with her father lying at death&#8217;s door there. And Chris said she hadn&#8217;t sworn, but she was overweary to argie about it, and knew right well that whatever she said now Mistress Strachan would spread a fine story about her.</p>

<p>And sure as death so she did, it was soon all over the Howe that that coarse quean at Blawearie had started to swear at Mistress Strachan while her father was lying near dead in the room above their heads. Only Chae himself didn&#8217;t believe it, and when he came up to Blawearie next day he whispered to Chris, <i>Is&#8217;t true you gave Kirsty a bit of a damning yesterday?</i> and when she said she hadn&#8217;t he said it was a pity, it was time that somebody did.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So there father lay and had lain ever since, all those five weeks he&#8217;d lain there half-paralysed, with a whistle beside his bed when he wanted attention, and God! that was often enough. Creeping to her bed half-dead at night Chris would find herself thinking a thing that wouldn&#8217;t bear a rethinking out here in the sun, with the hum of the heather-bees, heather-smell in her face, Lord! could she only lie here a day how she&#8217;d sleep and sleep. Fold over her soul and her heart and put them away with their hours of vexing and caring, the ploughing was done, she was set to her drilling, and faith! it was weary work!</p>

<p>She started and sighed and took her hands down from her face and listened again. Far down in Blawearie there rose the blast of an angry-blown whistle.</p>

<h3>FOUR</h3>

<h3>Harvest</h3>

<p>It seemed to her that but hardly could she have left the place since that May-day more than six years ago when Ewan had come seeking her through the red, evil weather. She closed her eyes and put out a hand against the greatest of the Standing Stones, the coarse texture of the stone leapt cold to her hand, for a shivering wind blew down the hills. She started at thought of another thing then, opening her eyes to look round; but there he was, still and safe as he stood and looked at her. She cried <i>Stay by me, Ewan!</i> and he came running to her side; and she caught his hand and closed her eyes again, praying in a wild compassion of pity for that Ewan whose hand lay far from hers.</p>

<p>Six years: Spring rains and seeding, harvests and winters and springs again since that day that Ewan had come seeking her here with his white, chill face that kindled to warmth and well-being when she called him at last. She&#8217;d cried in his arms then, tired and tired, as he carried her down the hill; and the rage was quite gone from him, he bore her into the house and up to their bed, and patted her hand, and said <i>Bide you quiet!</i> and went off down the hill at a run.</p>

<p>So she learned he had run, and to Peesie&#8217;s Knapp, but she didn&#8217;t know then, she sank and sank away into sleep, and awakened long after with Ewan and still another man come in the room, it was Meldrum from Bervie, the doctor. He peeled off his gloves from his long white hands, and peered at her like a hen with his gley, sharp eye. <i>What&#8217;s this you&#8217;ve been doing, Chris Guthrie?</i></p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t wait a reply but caught up her hand and wrist and listened, still like a hen, head on one side while Ewan stared at him greyly. Then he said <i>Well, well, that&#8217;s fine, let&#8217;s see a bit more of you, young Mistress Tavendale.</i></p>

<p>While he listened with the funny things at his ears and the end of it on her chest, she closed her eyes, ill no longer though drowsy still, and peeked sideways at Ewan, smiling at him. And then the doctor moved his stethoscope further down, it tickled her bared skin there and she knew he knew, and he straightened up <i>And you tell me you didn&#8217;t know what the thing was, Chris Tavendale?</i></p>

<p>She said <i>Oh, yes,</i> and he said <i>But not Ewan?</i> and she shook her head and they both laughed at Ewan standing there staring from one to the other, black hair unbrushed, she had gone near to killing him that morning. And then Dr. Meldrum shook him by the arm, <i>You&#8217;re going to be a father, Blawearie man, what think you of that? Away and make me a cup of tea while Chris and I go into more intimate details&#8212;you needn&#8217;t bide, she&#8217;s safe enough with an old man, bonny though she be.</i></p>

<p>All that he said as canny as ordering a jug of milk, Ewan gasped, and made to speak, and couldn&#8217;t but his face was blithe as he turned and ran down the stairs. They heard him singing below and old Meldrum cocked his head to the side and listened, <i>Damned easy for him to sing, eh, Chris? But you&#8217;ll sing yourself when this bairn of yours comes into the world. Let&#8217;s see if everything&#8217;s right.</i></p>

<p>It was. He put his hand on her shoulder when he finished and gave her a shake. <i>A body as fine and natural and comely as a cow or a rose, Chris Guthrie. You&#8217;ll have no trouble and you needn&#8217;t fret. But look after yourself, eat vegetables, and be still as kind to Ewan as the wear of the months will let you be. Good for him and good for you.</i> She nodded to that, understanding, and he gave her another shake and went down to Ewan, and drank the tea that Ewan had made, if tea it was, which you doubted later when you smelt the cups.</p>

<p>Ewan knowing, Meldrum knowing, it was as though a bank had gone down behind which she had dreamt a torrent and a storm would burst and blind and whelm her. But there was nothing there but the corn growing and the peewits calling, summer coming, marching up each morning with unbraided hair, the dew rising in whorling mists from the urgent corn that carpeted Ewan&#8217;s trim fields. Nothing to fear and much to do, most of all to tell Ewan not to fret, she wasn&#8217;t a doll, she&#8217;d be safe as a cow though she hoped to God she didn&#8217;t quite look like one. And Ewan said <i>You look fine, bonnier than ever,</i> saying it solemnly, meaning it, and she was glad, peeking at herself in the long mirror when she was alone, seeing gradually that smooth rounding of belly and hips below her frock&#8212;lucky she had never that ugliness that some poor folk have to bear, awful for them.</p>

<p>She took pleasure in being herself, in being as before, not making a difference, cooking and baking and running to the parks with the early morning piece for Ewan, he&#8217;d cry <i>Don&#8217;t run!</i> and she&#8217;d cry <i>Don&#8217;t blether!</i> and reach beside him, and sink down beside him midway the long potato rows he was hoeing, growing low and broad and well-branched, the shaws, it was set a fine year for potatoes. And as he sat and ate she&#8217;d gather his coat below her head for a pillow, and lean back with her arms outspread in the sun, and make of that few minutes her resting-time, listening to Ewan on the crops and the weather that was so good folk didn&#8217;t believe it could last, there must soon be a break of the fine interplay of the last two months.</p>

<p>That was late in June he said that, and all the dour Howe watched the sky darkly, certain some trick was on <i>up there.</i> For the rain that was needed came in the night, just enough, not more, as though cannily sprinkled, and the day would be fine with sun, you couldn&#8217;t want better; but it wasn&#8217;t in the nature of things it would last. And Chris said, dreamily, <i>Maybe things are changing for the better all round,</i> and Ewan said <i>Damn the fears!</i> his gaze far off and dark and intent, the crops and the earth in his bones and blood, and she&#8217;d look in his face and find content, not jealous or curious or caring though she herself found in his eyes a place with the crops and land. And she&#8217;d close her eyes in the sun-dazzle then, in the smell, green, pungent, strong and fine, of the coming potato shaws, and sometimes she&#8217;d doze and waken sun-weary, Ewan working a little bit off, not clattering his hoe lest she wake.</p>

<p>She made up her mind she&#8217;d have the baby born in the room that had once been her own. So she rubbed it and scrubbed it till it shone again and brought out the bed mattress and hung it to air, in the garden, between the beeches, all in leaf they were, so thick. You could hardly see the sky looking up in that malachite, whispering dome; and by as she looked came Long Rob of the Mill to settle his bills with Ewan, he saw Chris then and came to lean on the hedge, hatless, and long as ever, with the great moustaches and the iron blue eyes.</p>

<p>And he picked a sprig of the honeysuckle and bit it between his teeth. <i>This&#8217;ll be for the son, eh, Chris? And when are you having him born?</i> She said <i>Late September or early October, I think,</i> and Rob shook his head, it wasn&#8217;t the best time for bairns, though feint the fear for hers. And he laughed as he leaned there, minding something, and he told Chris of the thing, his own mother it was, the wife of a crofter down in the Reisk. She&#8217;d had her twelve children in sixteen years, nine of them died, Rob was the oldest and only a lad and he&#8217;d seen the youngest of his brothers born. <i>Seen? I helped, think of that, Chris quean!</i> And think she did and she shivered, and Rob said <i>That was daft, the telling of that. But things are fair right with you, then, Chris?</i></p>

<p>So maybe, going home, he told of Blawearie&#8217;s news; soon Kinraddie knew more than did Chris herself. Folk began to trail in about in the quiet of an evening, out of ill-fashionce, and nothing much more, they&#8217;d gley sidewise at Chris as they&#8217;d argue with Ewan, syne home they would go and tell it was true, <i>Ay, there&#8217;ll soon be a family Blawearie way, Chris must have fair have taken at the first bit sett.</i> But others knew better, Mutch and Munro, and the speak went round that the taking was well ere the marriage, Ewan had married the quean when she threatened him with law. Kinraddie mouthed that over, it was toothsome and tasty, and the speak came creeping up to Blawearie, Chris never knew how she heard it. But she did, Ewan did, and he swore to go out and kick the backsides of Mutch and Munro till they&#8217;d dream of sitting as a pleasure and a passion. And off he&#8217;d have set in the rage of the moment but Chris caught him and held him, that would only be daft, folk would think it the truer, the scandal; and if it made them the happier to think as they did, let them think!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then it seemed to Chris that her world up Blawearie brae began to draw in, in and about her and the life she carried, that moved now often and often, turning slow under her heart in the early days, but jerking with suddenness, a moment at a stretch now, sometimes, so that she would sit and gasp with closed eyes. In, nearer and nearer round herself and the house the days seemed to creep, Will in Argentine was somebody she&#8217;d met in a dream of the night, Aberdeenshire far away, nothing living or moving but shadows in sunlight or night outside the circle of the hills and woods she saw from Blawearie&#8217;s biggings. Then fancies came on her and passed, but were daft and straining and strange while they lasted, she couldn&#8217;t break herself of the things, they&#8217;d to wear and fade at their own bit gait.</p>

<p>One night it was that she couldn&#8217;t touch kye, Ewan had to do the milking himself, sore puzzled and handless he was but she couldn&#8217;t help that, though next morning she laughed at herself, what was there to fear in the milking of kye? Then came the day when they drove Chae Strachan&#8217;s sheep to the buchts and the libbing of the lambs went on till it nearly drove her mad, the thin young baaing that rose an unending plaint, the folk with their pipes and knives and the blood that ran in the sunlight. All in a picture it rose to her on the sound of that baaing, and she hid in the dairy at last, the only place that shut out the sound.</p>

<p>But another fad, and the one that lasted the longest, was fear that all sounds would go, fear of the night when it might be so nearly still, Ewan sleeping with his head in his arm as he sometimes did, soundless, till she&#8217;d think him dead and shake him to a sleepy wakefulness; and he&#8217;d ask <i>What&#8217;s wrong? Have I been stealing the blankets from you?</i> and she&#8217;d say <i>Yes,</i> ashamed to let him know of that fear of hers.</p>

<p>So she found the days blithe enough then, the scraich and scratch of hens in the close, the sound of the mower that Ewan drove up and down the rigs of the hay, the mooing of the calves wild-plagued with flies. Clyde&#8217;s neighing to a passing stallion. Only night was the time to be feared, if she woke and there was that stillness; but even the quietest night if she listened hard she&#8217;d hear the wisp-wisp of the beech leaves near to the window, quietening her, comforting her, she never knew why, as though the sap that swelled in branch and twig were one with the blood that swelled the new life below her navel, that coming day in the months to be a thing she&#8217;d share with that whisperer out in the darkness.</p>

<p>And oh, but the time was long! She could almost have wished that she and Ewan had bedded unblessed as Mutch said they had, the baby would have been here by now and not still to come, still waiting harvest and stooking and the gathering of stooks. But it lay with her, warm and shielded, and saw with her the growth and ripening of that autumn&#8217;s corn, yellow and great, and the harvest moons that came so soon in that year, red moons a-slant and a-tilt on the rim of the earth they saw as they went to bed, you felt it another land and another world that hung there in the quietness of the sky.</p>

<p>One night, the mid-days of August as they sat at meat, the door burst open and in strode Chae Strachan, a paper in his hand, and was fell excited, Chris listened and didn&#8217;t, a war was on, Britain was to war with Germany. But Chris didn&#8217;t care and Ewan didn&#8217;t either, he was thinking of his close that the weather might ruin; so Chae took himself off with his paper again, and after that, though she minded it sometimes, Chris paid no heed to the war, there were aye daft devils fighting about something or other, as Ewan had said; and God! they could fight till they were black and blue for all that he cared if only the ley field would come on a bit faster, it was near fit for cutting but the straw so short it fair broke your heart.</p>

<p>And out he&#8217;d go in the evening light, down to the ley park and poke about there, rig to rig, as though coaxing the straw to grow and grow in the night for his delight in the morning. A bairn with a toy, Chris thought, laughing as she watched him then; and then came that movement in her body as she watched Ewan still&#8212;a mother with his child he was, the corn his as this seed of his hers, burgeoning and ripening, growing to harvest.</p>

<p>The corn was first. Up and down the rigs on his brave new binder, Clyde and Bess each aside the pole, rode Ewan; and the corn bent and was smitten on the flyboard, and gathered up on the forking teeth and wound and bound and ejected. Up and down went the whirling arms, and fine harvest weather came then in Kinraddie, though it rained in Dee, folk said, and down in Forfar the year was wet. Park by park Ewan rode it down, Chris still could carry him a piece as he worked, but she walked slow now, careful and slow, and he&#8217;d jump from the binder and come running and meet her, and down he would sit her in the lithe of a stook while he stood and ate, his gaze as ever on the fields and sky, there was still the harvest to finish.</p>

<p>But finished it was, September&#8217;s end, and there came a blatter of rain next day, Chris saw the coming of the rain and the bright summer went as the stook stood laden and tall in the fields. And Chris found herself sick, a great pain came and gripped at her breast, at her thighs, she cried <i>Ewan!</i> and nearly fell and he ran to her. They stared in each other&#8217;s faces, hearing the rain, and then again the pain drove through and through Chris like a heated sword, and she set her teeth and shook Ewan free, she knew the things she&#8217;d to do. <i>It&#8217;ll maybe be a long time yet, but get Chae to drive for the doctor and nurse. He&#8217;ll bring the nurse back from Bervie, Chae.</i></p>

<p>Ewan stood and stared and his face was working, she smiled at him then though the pain of the sword was as nothing now, iron hooks were tearing in her body instead, rusty and dragging and blunt. She held up her face to be kissed and kept her teeth fast and said <i>Hurry, though I&#8217;m fine!</i> and syne watched him run down the road to the Knapp. Then, white, in a daze of pain, she began to walk backwards and forwards on the kitchen floor, as she knew she must do to bring on the birth quick, everything else was ready and waiting in the room upstairs. And after a while the pain waned and went, but she knew it would soon be back.</p>

<p>So she filled her a hot-water bottle and almost ran up the stairs to put it in the bed, almost running lest the pain come midway and catch her unaware. But it held off still, she smoothed out the sheets, brought out the rubber one she&#8217;d had bought, and tied that down, firm and strong, and set the great basin on the rug by the window and wondered what else there might be. Then she saw her face in the glass, it was flushed and bright and her eyes all hot; and suddenly she thought how strange it would be if she died, like the many women who died in childbed, she felt well and strong, they had felt the same, strange to think that her face might be dead and still in another day, that face that she looked at now, it couldn&#8217;t be hers, it was still the face of a quean.</p>

<p>From the window she saw Ewan running back and as she reached to the foot of the stairs to meet him the pain came on her again, she had to sit down. But that was daft, it would make it last longer, she struggled to her feet and walked in the kitchen again, Ewan was in the doorway, a white blur of a face and nothing else unless she looked at him hard and hard. He kept saying <i>Chris, go and lie down!</i> and she opened her mouth and gasped and meant to tell him she was fine; and instead found herself swearing and swearing, terrible words she hadn&#8217;t known she knew, they were wrung from her lips as she went stumbling to and fro, better than screaming, women screamed, but she wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>And then came relief again, the kitchen straightened and she sat down, Ewan emerged from his blur and made her tea. Something kept worrying her&#8212;what was he to have for his dinner? She couldn&#8217;t remember the thing she&#8217;d intended, and gave it up, her tormentors were nearby again. <i>Boil yourself an egg, Ewan!</i> she gasped, and he didn&#8217;t understand, he thought it something she wanted&#8212;<i>Boil what?</i> And at that a frenzy of irritation came on her, <i>Oh, boil your head if you like!</i> and she dragged herself to her feet, the clock on the mantelshelf was expanding and contracting, its dial blurred and brightened as she stood. And then she was sure, she cried <i>Ewan, help me up to the room,</i> for she knew that her time had come.</p>

<p>What happened then she didn&#8217;t know, there came a clear patch and she found herself nude, all but a stocking, it wouldn&#8217;t come off, she sat on the bedside and tried, Ewan tried, it was so funny she giggled in spite of the pain. And then she saw Ewan&#8217;s face, it had grown to the face of an old man, now, she must lie and get him out of the room. She cried <i>Mind the fire, Ewan, there&#8217;s no wood there, run and hack some,</i> and when he was out of the room she could heed to herself and her agony at last; and she bit the sheets, she rolled herself tight in a ball, the pain seemed to go for a moment, maybe she had smothered the baby, she didn&#8217;t care, she couldn&#8217;t abide it, not through hours and hours and days and days, for weeks it had gone on now, she had seen the room darken and lighten and night come, tormented by Ewan and father her body, and Will was dead, they had tortured him first.</p>

<p>She cried <i>Will!</i> then and opened her eyes from an hour-long sleep. In the room was the doctor and the nurse from Bervie, he came over to her side, old Meldrum, <i>Well Chris lass, how do you feel? Fine to send for us in such a stour, and here we coming tearing up to find you sleeping like a lamb! This is Mrs. Ogilvie, you&#8217;ve heard of her.</i></p>

<p>Chris tried to speak, and managed, her body was a furnace, but she managed to speak, she didn&#8217;t get it clear and she tried again. And Mrs. Ogilvie patted her and said <i>Don&#8217;t bother with that. Do you feel you&#8217;re getting on fine?</i> Dr. Meldrum came back then, <i>Well, let&#8217;s see;</i> and Chris poised herself on the rim of a glistening cup of pain while they looked at and felt at and straightened something alien and white, it was her own body she remembered. Meldrum said <i>Fine, fine, it shouldn&#8217;t be long, I&#8217;ll wait below,</i> and went out and closed the door, he hated confinements. Mrs. Ogilvie sat down and next minute jumped to her feet again, <i>Don&#8217;t do that, Mrs. Tavendale, don&#8217;t grip yourself up! Slacken and its easy, wish it to come, there&#8217;s a brave girl!</i></p>

<p>Chris tried: it was torment: the beast moved away from her breasts, scrabbled and tore and returned again, it wasn&#8217;t a beast, red-hot pincers were riving her apart. Riven and riven she bit at her lips, the blood on her tongue, she couldn&#8217;t bite more, she heard herself scream then, twice. And then there were feet on the stairs, the room rose and fell, hands on her everywhere, holding her, tormenting her, she cried out again, ringingly, deep, a cry that ebbed to a sigh, the cry and the sigh with which young Ewan Tavendale came into the world in the farm-house of Blawearie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So quick as all that, she was lucky, folk said, bringing a birth in a forenoon, just; it was twelve when Ewan was born. Some folk, Mrs. Ogilvie told, had to thresh from dawn to dusk and through another night to another day, and Chris lay and nodded and said <i>Yes, I know,</i> and fell fast asleep, she didn&#8217;t dream at all. And, waking, she found herself washed and dried, a new nightgown put on her and Mrs. Ogilvie knitting by the side of the bed, nothing else, oh! she couldn&#8217;t have dreamt and not known it. She whispered, scared, <i>My baby?</i> and Mrs. Ogilvie whispered <i>Beside you, don&#8217;t crush him,</i> and Chris turned round her head and saw then beside her a face as small as though carved from an apple, near, perfect and small, with a fluff of black hair and a blue tinge on long eyelids, and a mouth that was Ewan&#8217;s and a nose her own and she nearly cried out <i>Oh, my baby!</i></p>

<p>So she lay and wondered, near cried again, and put out her hand, it felt strong and quick, only heavy, and her fingers passed up and along, under its swathings, a body as small and warm as a cat&#8217;s, with a heart that beat steady and assured. And the baby opened his eyes and fluttered them at her and yawned and she saw a tongue like a little red fish in the little red mouth; and the blue-shaded eyelids went down again and young Ewan Tavendale slept.</p>

<p>Sweet to lie beside him in the hours that went by, sleeping herself now and then and wakening to watch him, not ugly as she&#8217;d thought he&#8217;d be, lovely and perfect. And then he moved and whimpered, unrestful, and was picked from the bed in Mrs. Ogilvie&#8217;s hands, and fluttered his eyelids at her, Chris saw, and opened his mouth and weeked like a kitten. And Mrs. Ogilvie said <i>He&#8217;s hungry now,</i> Chris found him in her arms at last, and hugged him, just once, and held him to her breast.</p>

<p>The blind little mouth came kissing and lapping, he wailed his disappointment, his little hands clawing at her. Then his lips found her nipple, it hurt and it didn&#8217;t, it was as though he were draining the life from her body, there was nothing better than to die that way, he was hers close and closer than his father had been, closer than again could any child be. And she wondered above him and kissed his black hair, damp still from the travail of birth; and looked at the eyes that stared so unwinkingly as the hungry lips clung to her breast. So at last he was finished, then Ewan came up, he&#8217;d come while she slept before and he bent and kissed her and she cried <i>Mind the baby!</i> and he said <i>By God, am I like to forget?</i> And he wiped his forehead, poor Ewan!</p>

<p>In a week Mrs. Ogilvie was gone and Chris felt so well she was up and about, it was daft to lie wearied and feckless when she felt so fine. So down to the kitchen and the shining of the October sun she came, she and her baby, into the whisper and murmur of that war that had so excited Chae Strachan.</p>

<p>For it was on, not a haver only, every soul that came up to look at young Ewan began to speak of it sooner or later. Chae came and looked at young Ewan and tickled his toes and said <i>Ay, man!</i> And he told them they&#8217;d brought out a fine bit bairn between them, every man might yet have to fight for bairn and wife ere this war was over; and he said that the Germans had broken loose, fair devils, and were raping women and braining bairns all over Belgium, it was hell let loose. And Ewan said

<i>Who&#8217;ll win, then?</i> and Chae said if the Germans did there&#8217;d be an end of both peace and progress forever, there wouldn&#8217;t be safety in the world again till the Prussians&#8212;and they were a kind of German, with meikle spiked helmets, awful brutes, and the very worst&#8212;were beaten back to the hell they came from. But Ewan just yawned and said <i>Oh, to hell with them and their hell both, Chae! Are you going to the mart the morn?</i></p>

<p>For he didn&#8217;t care, Ewan; but the mart was as bad, nobody spoke of anything but war, Munro of the Cuddiestoun was there, and Mutch, they&#8217;d a fair drink in their bellies, both, and swore they&#8217;d &#8216;list the morn were they younger, by God. That was just the drink speaking, no doubt, but the very next day the Upperhill foreman, James Leslie he was that had taken Ewan&#8217;s place, went into Aberdeen and joined in the Gordons, he was the first man to go from Kinraddie and was killed fell early. But folk thought him fair daft, showing off and looking for a holiday, just, there was no use coming to such stir as that when the war would so soon be over. For the papers all said that it would, right fierce they were, <i>Man, some of those editors are right rough creatures, God pity the Germans if they&#8217;d their hands on them!</i> And folk shook their heads, and agreed that the newspaper billies were ill to run counter.</p>

<p>But the Germans didn&#8217;t care&#8212;maybe they didn&#8217;t read the papers, said Long Rob of the Mill; they just went on with their raping of women and their gutting of bairns, till Chae Strachan came up to Blawearie one night with a paper in his hand and a blaze on his face, and he cried that he for one was off to enlist, old Sinclair could heed to the Knapp and to Kirsty. And Ewan cried after him, <i>You&#8217;re havering, man, you don&#8217;t mean it!</i> but Chae cried back <i>Damn&#8217;t ay, that I do!</i> And sure as death he did and went off, by Saturday a letter came to Peesie&#8217;s Knapp that told he had joined the North Highlanders and been sent to Perth.</p>

<p>So there was such speak and stir as Kinraddie hadn&#8217;t known for long, sugar was awful up in price and Chris got as much as she could from the grocer and stored it away in the barn. Then Ewan heard funny things about the sermon that the Reverend Gibbon had preached the Sunday before, and though he couldn&#8217;t bear with a kirk he broke his habit and put on his best suit and went down to the service next Sabbath.</p>

<p>There was a fell crowd there, more than Ewan had heard of the last week&#8217;s sermon, and the place was all on edge to hear what the Reverend Gibbon would say. He looked bigger and more like a bull than ever, Ewan thought, as he mounted the pulpit, there was nothing unusual as he gave out the hymn and the prayer. But then he took a text, Ewan couldn&#8217;t mind which, about Babylon&#8217;s corruptions, they&#8217;d been right coarse there. And he said that God was sending the Germans for a curse and a plague on the world because of its sins, it had grown wicked and lustful, God&#8217;s anger was loosed as in the days of Attila. How long it would rage, to what deeps of pain their punishments would go, only God and His Anger might know. But from the chastisement by blood and fire the nations might rise anew, Scotland not the least in its ancient health and humility, to tread again the path to grace.</p>

<p>And just as he got there, up rose old Sinclair of the Netherhill, all the kirk watched him, and he put on his hat and he turned his back and went step-stepping slow down the aisle, he wouldn&#8217;t listen to this brute defending the German tinks and some friend that he called Attila. Hardly had he risen when Mutch rose too, syne Cuddiestoun, and they too clapped on their hats; and Ellison half made to rise but his wife pulled him down, he looked daft as a half-throttled turkey then, Ella White wasn&#8217;t to have him make himself a fool for any damned war they waged. But the minister turned red and then white and he stuttered when he saw folk leaving; and his sermon quietened down, he finished off early and rattled off the blessing as though it was a cursing. Outside in the kirkyard some young folk gathered to clout him in the lug as he came from the kirk, but the elders were there and they edged them away, and Mr. Gibbon threaded the throngs like a futret with kittle, and made for the Manse, and padlocked the gate.</p>

<p>But Ewan didn&#8217;t care one way or the other, as he told to Chris. The minister might be right or be wrong with his Babylons and whores and might slobber Attila every night of the week, Blawearie had its crop all in and that was what mattered. And Chris said <i>Yes, what a blither about a war, isn&#8217;t it, Ewan?</i> and tickled young Ewan as he lay on her lap. And he laughed and kicked and his father sat down and looked at him, solemn, and said it was fair wonderful, <i>Did you see him look up at me then, Chris quean?</i></p>

<p>So they were douce and safe and blithe in Blawearie though Kinraddie was unco with Chae Strachan gone. Kirsty came up on a visit and cried when she sat in the kitchen beside the crib, Chris made her tea but she wouldn&#8217;t take comfort. She said she knew well enough Chae&#8217;d never come back, he was in such a rage with the Germans he&#8217;d just run forward in his bit of the front and kill and kill till he&#8217;d fair lost himself. Chris said <i>And they&#8217;re maybe not such bad folk as the papers make out,</i> and at that Kirsty Strachan jumped up <i>So, you&#8217;re another damned pro-German as well, are you? There&#8217;s over-many of your kind in Kinraddie.</i> Chris stared clean amazed, but out Kirsty Strachan went running, still crying, and that was the last they saw of her in many a week, maybe she was ashamed of her outburst.</p>

<p>Whether or not <i>she</i> was, there could be never a doubt about the Reverend Gibbon. For the next Sabbath day, when another great crowd came down to the kirk to hear him preach, they got all the patriotism they could wish, the minister said that the Kaiser was the Antichrist, and that until this foul evil had been swept from the earth there could be neither peace nor progress again. And he gave out a hymn then, <i>Onward, Christian Soldiers</i> it was, and his own great bull&#8217;s voice led the singing, he had fair become a patriot and it seemed likely he thought the Germans real bad. But Long Rob of the Mill, when he heard the story, said it was a sight more likely that he thought the chance of losing his kirk and collections a damned sight worse than any German that was ever yet clecked.</p>

<p>For, and it grew a fair scandal all through the Howe, you could hardly believe it, it was funny enough, Long Rob of the Mill didn&#8217;t hold with the war. He said it was a lot of damned nonsense, those that wanted to fight, the M.P.s and bankers and editors and muckers, should all be locked up in a pleiter of a park and made to gut each other with graips: there&#8217;d be no great loss to the world and a fine bit sight it would make for decent folk to look on at. But for folk with sense to take part in the soss and yammer about King and country was just plain hysteria; and as for Belgium invaded, it got what it needed, what about the Congo and your Belgians there? Not that the Germans weren&#8217;t as bad, they were all tarred with the same black brush.</p>

<p>But, though folk weren&#8217;t patriots as daft as Chae Strachan, that didn&#8217;t look when he was being laughed at, they knew right well that Long Rob couldn&#8217;t lie like that, the long, rangy childe, without being pro-German, as the papers called it. For all the papers were full of pro-Germans then, British folk that thought that the German rascals were right; and in England folk went and smashed in their windows, such a rage they were in with the pro-Germans for being so coarse. There was little danger that they&#8217;d smash Rob&#8217;s windows, there were few that cared to tackle the childe except Chae Strachan that was training in Perth.</p>

<p>So the whole stour might well have blown over, Rob was a well-liked billy and you needn&#8217;t heed his blithers, if the Reverend Gibbon hadn&#8217;t taken to the business and preached a sermon about tinks and traitors and a lot he preached about a jade called Jael, fell uncanny she&#8217;d been, right holy, though, and she&#8217;d killed a childe Sisera that she couldn&#8217;t thole, because he was coarse to the Jews. And the Reverend Gibbon boomed out she was fine, a patriot and a light unto Israel she&#8217;d been, and we in like manner must act the same, right here in our midst were traitors that sided with the Antichrist, shame on Kinraddie that it should be so!</p>

<p>Folk listened to the sermon and fair got excited, and after dinner that Sabbath a horde of billies, some came from Kinraddie though most did not, but Upperhill&#8217;s new foreman was there, and an awful patriot childe just like Gordon himself, they went down to the Mill, and there was Long Rob sitting out by his door, smoking at his pipe and reading in a book, coarse stite about God and God knows what. And the Upper-hill foreman cried out <i>Here&#8217;s the Kaiser&#8217;s crony, let&#8217;s duck the mucker!</i> and the lot made a run at Rob and got him gripped in their hands, Rob thought it some joke and he laughed at them, setting by his bit book. But they soon let him know they were serious enough, they were clean worked up about the sermon and Long Rob the Antichrist&#8217;s friend, and they started to haul Rob over to the mill-course then, where the water was sparkling and raging from a good bit spate in the hills.</p>

<p>Syne at last Rob knew they meant what they said, folk told that he gave a great cry that wasn&#8217;t a curse and wasn&#8217;t a shout, it was both together; and as they dragged him he lifted his foot, real coarse-like, and he kicked the foreman at the Upperhill right in the tender parts then, and the foreman at the Upperhill he screamed like a fell stuck pig; and God! folk laughed right well when they heard about that. Well, the next thing that happened was that Rob got a hand free then, and he took a childe near him, a meikle man from the Mains, a clout in the ear that stretched him flat; and then Rob was free and he ran, all the rest at his heels, for the house. But he could run right well, could Rob and fair outdistanced the pack, and he leapt inside and he barred the door.</p>

<p>So they threw some stones and rammed at the door with their shoulders, half-shamed by then at the stour they were raising, and maybe they knew they&#8217;d feel fools by Monday; and they might have gone home in another minute if it hadn&#8217;t been that the meikle Mains man, him that Rob had couped on the ground with a clout in the ear, crawled up to his feet and picked up a great stone; and crack! through the kitchen window it went with a bang and a splinter inside!</p>

<p>Next minute the door flung open, they turned and looked and there was Long Rob, a gun in his hand and his face fair grey with rage. Some cried <i>Take care, man, now, put down that gun!</i> but they edged away back for all that. And Rob cried out <i>Smash in my window you would, then, would you, you scum?</i> and he swung the gun at the nearest billy and let drive at him. The pellets sang past the billy&#8217;s head and he&#8217;d had enough of the war, he turned and ran like a rabbit; and the others scattered and ran as well, and Long Rob ran after them, and his gun went bang! again and again, you could hear it all over Kinraddie.</p>

<p>Folk ran to their doors, they thought the Germans had landed and were looting the Mearns; Chris, who had run across the Blawearie cornyard, shaded her eyes and looked over the country and at last she saw them, the running figures, like beetles in the distance, they fanned out and ran from the Mill as focus. And behind ran another that stopped now and then, and a puff of smoke went up at each stopping, and there came the bang of the gun. Mist was coming down and it blinded the battlefield, and through it the attacking army ran in an awful rout, Chris saw them vanish into its coming and Long Rob, still shooting, go scudding in chase.</p>

<p>So that was the result of the Reverend Gibbon&#8217;s sermon, Kinraddie fair seethed with the news next day, all about the attack on the Mill and how Rob had chased the childes that came up against him, some could hardly sit down for a week after that, so full were their backsides with pellets. And some said that Long Rob was a coarse tink brute, if he was willing to fight like that at the Mill it was him that should go out to France and fight; but others, though they weren&#8217;t so many, Chris and Ewan were among them, liked Long Rob and sided with him, and said it was a damn poor show for Scotland if her patriots aye ran as they had at the Mill. That had been the Sunday, but on Wednesday was another happening, and God knows what mightn&#8217;t have come of <i>it</i> but for the interfering of the daftie Tony, him that bided at Cuddiestoun.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d been stitering along the Denburn road, had Tony, when he rounded a bend and there, on the road outside the Mill, was the Reverend Gibbon, his bicycle was lying in the stour and Long Rob had him gripped by the collar, and if he wasn&#8217;t in danger of a bash in the face appearances were sore deceptive. For Long Rob had seen the minister come riding in the distance and knew his black coat and stopped the Mill and ran down to the road to ask what the hell the Reverend had meant by saying he was friends with the Antichrist. And the Reverend Gibbon turned red with rage and cried <i>Stand out of my way there, Rob,</i> and Rob cried <i>Stand still you first, my man, for we&#8217;ve a bit bone to pick!</i> and as the minister tried to ride him down Rob caught the handles and twisted them sore, and off the minister came, like a sack of corn, right flump in Rob&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>And Rob gave him a bit shake and asked <i>Who&#8217;s pro-German?</i> and the minister swore himself blue and made at Rob, and Rob shook him like a futret a rabbit, and syne stood back and looked close at his face, and made up his mind that he&#8217;d smash in the minister&#8217;s bit nose right then, he&#8217;d seen that kind of thing done before and it fair sossed up a pretty man, you just struck and struck till the bone gave way.</p>

<p>So Rob was just starting to mash up the minister childe when round the bend with a funny bit screech came the daftie Tony, he scraiched like a hen with a seed in its throat and ran and caught at Rob&#8217;s arm. <i>He&#8217;s only a half-witted cleric, Rob, you&#8217;ll dirty your hands on him,</i> he cried, and both Rob and minister, sore astounded, stopped from their fighting and stared at the creature, the impudence of him with his wee red beard, and him only a daftie, like. But he nodded to the minister <i>Get while the going&#8217;s good and your hide&#8217;s still intact,</i> he said, and if you&#8217;d believe it the minister louped on his bicycle without a word, and off he rode; and Long Rob turned and asked the daftie where he&#8217;d hidden his sense all the time they&#8217;d known him, but Tony stood still like a stock of rags, a daft-like look on his face. And when Rob spoke to him again he just smiled like a gowk, and went shuffling away through the stour.</p>

<p>Some said that if all things were true that wouldn&#8217;t be a lie, but Rob swore to it, he wasn&#8217;t boasting what he&#8217;d done to the minister, he said, he was just so astonished at Tony he&#8217;d to tell them the story to make Tony&#8217;s part plain. Cuddiestoun swore &#8216;twas a lie from beginning to end, the thing you&#8217;d expect from a darned pro-German, like; but he didn&#8217;t say that to Long Rob, he was over coarse in the feet, Munro, to run as fleet as the other billies had when Rob got in action. But he stopped his trade with Long Rob and he carted his corn for crushing and bruising over to the mill at Mondynes, syne Mutch of Bridge End did the same. Ah well, they might do that if they liked, folk as a rule were hardly so daft as leave the best miller for miles around just because of his saying that all the Germans could hardly be tinks. Maybe, you know, there was something in what the man said, coarse devils though most of the Germans were.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Chris didn&#8217;t care, sitting there at Blawearie with young Ewan at her breast, her man beside her, Blawearie theirs and the grain a fine price, forbye that the stirks sold well in the marts. Maybe there was war and bloodshed and that was awful, but far off also, you&#8217;d hear it like the North Sea cry in a morning, a crying and a thunder that became unending as the weeks went by, part of life&#8217;s plan, fringing the horizon of your days with its pelt and uproar. So the new year came in and Chris watched young Ewan change and grow there at her breast, he was quick of temper like his father, good like his mother, she told Ewan; and Ewan laughed <i>God, maybe you&#8217;re right! You could hardly be wrong in a thing after bringing a bairn like that in the world.</i> And she laughed at him <i>But you helped a little!</i> and he blushed as red as he always did, they seemed daft as ever in their love as the days wore on.</p>

<p>It was still as strange and as kind to lie with him, live with him, watch the sweat on his forehead when he came from tramping a day in the parks at the heels of his horses; still miracle to hear beside her his soundless breathing in the dark of the night when their pleasure was past and he slept so soon. But she didn&#8217;t herself, those nights as the Winter wore to March, into Spring: she&#8217;d lie and listen to that hushed breathing of his one side of her, the boy&#8217;s quicker breath in his cradle out by&#8212;content, content, what more could she have or want than the two of them, body and blood and breath? And morning would bring her out of her bed to tend young Ewan and make the breakfast and clean out the byre and the stable singing: she worked never knowing she tired and Long Rob of the Mill came on her one morning as she cleaned the manure from the stable and he cried <i>The Spring of life, eh, Chris quean. Sing it and cherish it &#8216;twill never come again!</i></p>

<p>Different from the old Rob he looked, she thought, but thought that carelessly, hurried to be in to young Ewan. But she stopped and watched him swing down the rigs to Ewan by the side of his horses, Ewan with his horses halted on the side of the brae and the breath of them rising up like a steam. And she heard Ewan call <i>Ay, man, Rob,</i> and Rob call <i>Ay, man, Ewan,</i> and they called the truth, they seemed fine men both against the horizon of Spring, their feet deep laired in the wet clay ground, brown and great, with their feet on the earth and the sky that waited behind. And Chris looked at them over-long, they glimmered to her eyes as though they had ceased to be there, mirages of men dreamt by a land grown desolate against its changing sky. And the Chris that had ruled those other two selves of herself, content, unquestioning these many months now, shook her head and called herself daft.</p>

<p>That year&#8217;s harvest fell sharp away, but the price of corn made up for it, other prices might rise but farming folk did well. So it went in the winter and into the next year too, Ewan took in a drove of Irish steers to eat up the lush green grass of nineteen-sixteen. They grew fat and round in the shortest while, Chris proud to see them, so many beasts had Blawearie. You&#8217;d hardly believe &#8216;twas here father had chaved and fought for a living the way he did; but that was before the War.</p>

<p>For it still went on, rumbling its rumours like the thunder of summer beyond the hills. But nobody knew now when it would finish, not even Chae Strachan come home, a soldier all the way from the front, as they called it; in the orra-looking khaki he came, with two stripes sewn on his arm, he said they had made him a corporal. He came up to Blawearie the night he got home and scraped his feet on the scraper outside and came dandering into the kitchen as aye he had done, not knocking but crying through the door, <i>Ay, folk, are you in?</i></p>

<p>So there was Chae, Chris gave a loud gasp to see him, Chae himself, so altered you&#8217;d hardly believe it, Chae himself, thin, his fine eyes queered and strained somehow. Even his laugh seemed different, hearty as it was, and he cried <i>God, Chris, I&#8217;m not a ghost yet!</i> and syne Chris and Ewan were shaking his hands and sitting him down and pouring him a dram and another after that. And young Ewan came running to see and cried <i>soldier!</i> and Chae caught him and swung him up from the floor and cried <i>Chris&#8217;s bairn&#8212;God, it can&#8217;t be, I mind the day he was born, just yesterday it was!</i></p>

<p>Young Ewan took little to strangers, most, not frightened but keep-your-distance he was, but he made no try to keep distant from Chae, he sat on his knee as Chris spread them supper and Chae spoke up about things in the War, it wasn&#8217;t so bad if it wasn&#8217;t the lice. He said they were awful, but Chris needn&#8217;t be feared, he&#8217;d been made to stand out in the close by Kirsty and strip off everything he had on, and fling the clothes in a tub and syne get into another himself. So he was fell clean, and God! he found it a change not trying to reach up his shoulders to get at some devil fair sucking and sucking the life from his skin.</p>

<p>And he gave a great laugh when he told them that, his old laugh queerly crippled it was. And Ewan asked what he thought of the Germans, were they truly coarse? And Chae said he was damned if he knew, he&#8217;d hardly seen one alive, though a body or so you saw now and then, gey green and <i>feuch! there&#8217;s a supper on the table!</i> Well, out there you hardly did fighting at all, you just lay about in those damned bit trenches and had a keek at the soil they were made of. And man, it was funny land, clay and a kind of black marl, but the French were no good as farmers at all, they just pleitered and pottered in little bit parks that you&#8217;d hardly use as a hanky to wipe your neb. Chae didn&#8217;t like the French at all, he said they were damned poor folk you&#8217;d to fight for, them, meaner than dirt and not half so sweet.</p>

<p>And Ewan listened and said <i>So you don&#8217;t think that I should join up, Chae?</i> and Chris stared at him, Chae stared at him, young Ewan stared, and they all three stared till Chae snorted <i>There are fools enough in the fighting as it is.</i> Chris felt something holding her throat, she&#8217;d to cough and cough, trying to speak, and couldn&#8217;t, and Ewan looked at her shamed-like and blushed and said <i>Och, I was asking, only.</i></p>

<p>Chae went round all Kinraddie on his leave that time and found changes enough to open his eyes, maybe he was fell wearied with the front, folk thought, there was nothing on there but their pleitering and fighting. And the first change he saw the first morning, did Chae, lying down on his bed for the pleasure of it and Kirsty at the making of his breakfast. And Chae sat up in his bed to reach for his pipe when he looked from the window and he gave a great roar; and he louped from his bed in his sark so that Kirsty came running and crying <i>What is&#8217;t? Is&#8217;t a wound?</i></p>

<p>But she found Chae standing by the window then, cursing himself black in the face he was, and he asked how long had <i>this</i> been going? So Mistress Strachan looked out the way he looked and she saw it was only the long bit wood that ran by the Peesie&#8217;s Knapp that vexed him, it was nearly down the whole stretch of it, now. It made a gey difference to the look-out faith! but fine for Kinraddie the woodmen had been, they&#8217;d lodged at the Knapp and paid high for their board. But Chae cried out <i>To hell with their board, the bastards, they&#8217;re ruining my land, do you hear!</i> And he pulled on his trousers and boots and would fair have run over the park and been at them; but Kirsty caught at his sark and held him back and cried <i>Have you fair gone mad with the killing of Germans?</i></p>

<p>And he asked her hadn&#8217;t she got eyes in her head, the fool, not telling him before that the wood was cut? It would lay the whole Knapp open to the north-east now, and was fair the end of a living here. And Mistress Strachan answered up that she wasn&#8217;t a fool, and they&#8217;d be no worse than the other folk, would they? all the woods in Kinraddie were due to come down. Chae shouted <i>What, others?</i> and went out to look; and when he came back he didn&#8217;t shout at all, he said he&#8217;d often minded of them out there in France, the woods, so bonny they were, and thick and grave, fine shelter and lithe for the cattle. Nor more than that would he say, it seemed then to Kirsty that he quietened down, and was quiet and queer all his leave, it was daft to let a bit wood go vex him like that.</p>

<p>But the last night of his leave he climbed to Blawearie and he said there was nothing but the woods and their fate that could draw his eyes. For over by the Mains he&#8217;d come on the woodmen, teams and teams of them hard at work on the long bit forest that ran up the high brae, sparing nothing they were but the yews of the Manse. And up above Upperhill they had cut down the larch, and the wood was down that lay back of old Pooty&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Folk had told him the trustees had sold it well, they got awful high prices, the trustees did, it was wanted for aeroplanes and such-like things. And over at the office he had found the factor and the creature had peeked at Chae through his horn-rimmed glasses and said that the Government would replant all the trees when the War was won. And Chae had said that would console him a bloody lot, sure, if he&#8217;d the chance of living two hundred years and seeing the woods grow up as some shelter for beast and man: but he doubted he&#8217;d not last so long. Then the factor said they must all do their bit at a sacrifice, and Chae asked <i>And what sacrifices have you made, tell me, you scrawny wee mucker?</i></p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t fair to the factor, maybe, who was a decent childe and not fit to fight, but Chae was so mad he hardly knew what he said, and didn&#8217;t much care. So when he fell in with old Ellison things were no better. For Ellison&#8217;d grown fair big in the mind and the pouch, folk said he was making silver like a dung-heap sourocks; and he&#8217;d bought him a car and another piano; and he said <i>Ow, it&#8217;s you, Charles lad! Are you home for long?</i> and he said <i>And I&#8217;ll bet you want back to the front line, eh?</i> And Chae said that he&#8217;d be wrong in the betting, faith ay! <i>Did you ever hear tell of a body of a woman that wanted a new bairn put back in her womb?</i> And Ellison gowked and said <i>No.</i>

And Chae said <i>And neither have I, you gowk-eyed gomeril,</i> and left him at that; and it was hardly a kindly remark, you would say.</p>

<p>But it seemed the same wherever he went in Kinraddie, except at the Mill and his father-in-law&#8217;s; every soul made money and didn&#8217;t care a damn though the War outlasted their lives; they didn&#8217;t care though the land was shaved of its timber till the whole bit place would soon be a waste with the wind a-blow over heath and heather where once the corn came green. At Cuddiestoun he came on the Munro pair, they were rearing up hundreds of chickens that year and they sold them at great bit prices to the Aberdeen hospitals. So busy they were with their incubators they&#8217;d but hardly time to take notice of him, Mistress Munro snapped and tweeted at him, still like a futret, and the creature wrinkled its long thin neb: <i>Ah well, we&#8217;ll have to get on with our work. Fine being you and a soldier, Chae, with your holidays and all. But poor folk aye have to work.</i> Munro himself looked shamed at that and coloured all over his ugly face, poor stock, but he&#8217;d hardly time to give Chae a dram, so anxious he was with a new brood of hens.</p>

<p>So Chae left him fell quick, the place got on his stomach and syne as he held through the parks he came bang on Tony, standing right mid-way the turnip-field. And his eyes were fixed on the ground and God! he might well have stood there for days by the look of him. Chae cried out to him, <i>Ay, then, Tony man</i> not expecting any reply, but Tony looked up and aside, <i>Ah, Chae, so the mills of God still grind?</i></p>

<p>And Chae went on, and he thought of that, a real daft-like speak he thought it at first, but further up the brae as he held by Upprums, he scratched his head, was the thing so daft? He stopped and looked back, and there, far below, was the Tony childe, standing, glued to the ground. And Chae shivered in a way, and went on.</p>

<p>So Chae wandered his round of Kinraddie, a strange place and desolate with its crash of trees and its missing faces. And not that alone, for the folk seemed different, into their bones the War had eaten, they were money-mad or mad with grief for somebody killed or somebody wounded&#8212;like Mistress Gordon of the Upperhill, all her pride gone now because of the Jock she had loved and aye called John. But it was Jock she called him when Chae sat with her in the parlour then, and she told him the news of her blinded son in the hospital in England.</p>

<p>He wouldn&#8217;t ever see again, it wasn&#8217;t just a nervous trouble or anything like that, he&#8217;d drawn back the bandages when she went to see him and shown her the great red holes in his head; and syne he&#8217;d laughed at her, demented like, and cried: <i>What think you of your son now, old wife?&#8212;the son you wanted to make a name for you with his bravery in Kinraddie? Be proud, be proud, I&#8217;ll be home right soon to crawl round the park and I&#8217;ll show these holes to every bitch in the Mearns that&#8217;s looking for a hero.</i> He&#8217;d fair screamed the words at his mother and a nurse had come running and soothed him down, she said he didn&#8217;t know what he said, but Mistress Gordon had never a doubt about that. And she told Chae about it and wept uncovered, her braveness and her Englishness all fair gone; and when Gordon came into the room he looked different too, shrivelled up he was, he&#8217;d taken to drink, folk said.</p>

<p>So Chae went out across the parks to the Bridge End then and half-wished that he&#8217;d missed the Upperhill. But across the nethermost park below the larch wood he ran into young Maggie Jean, her that Andy the daftie had near mischieved, grown a gey lass, and he hardly knew her. But she knew him fine and smiled at him, blithe and open. <i>It&#8217;s Chae Strachan! You look fine as a soldier, Chae! And please can I have a button?</i> So he cut off a button from his tunic for her and they smiled at each other, and he went out across the fields with a lighter heart then, she was sweet as a sprig of Blawearie &#8217;suckle.</p>

<p>Bridge End he found with Alec away, he&#8217;d gone selling sheep in Stonehaven. But Mistress Mutch was there and she sat and smoked at a cigarette and told him that Alec was still a fell patriot, he&#8217;d enrolled in the volunteers of Glenbervie and every other night went down to Drumlithie for drill, a sight for sore eyes, the gowks, prancing about like dogs with diarrh&oelig;a, that&#8217;s what they minded her of.</p>

<p>And she asked Chae when the War was to end, and Chae said

<i>God only knows</i> and she asked <i>And you still believe in Him?</i> And Chae was real shocked, a man might have doubts and his disbelief, you expected a woman to be different, they needed more support in the world. But now that he thought of God for himself he just couldn&#8217;t say, there was more of his Enemy over in France, that minded him now he must give the Reverend Gibbon a look up at the Manse. But Mistress Mutch said <i>Haven&#8217;t you heard, then? Mr. Gibbon&#8217;s gone, he&#8217;s a Colonel-chaplain in Edinburgh now, or something like that; and he wears a right brave uniform with a black hanky across the neck of it. His father&#8217;s come down to take his place, an old bit stock that drinks German blood by the gill with his porridge, by the way he preaches.</i></p>

<p>At Pooty&#8217;s Chae knocked and knocked and got feint the answer. And folk were to tell him that wasn&#8217;t surprising, old Pooty had taken to locking himself in nowadays, he got queerer and queerer, he said every night he heard men tramping the roads in the dark, chill hours, and they crept off the roads and slithered and slipped by the hedges and fields, and he knew who they were, they were Germans, the German dead from out of the earth that had come to work ill on Scotland. And even in the daytime if you but looked quick, right sharp and sudden between the bending of a bough or the bar of a gate, you&#8217;d see a white German face, distorted still in the last red pain, haunting the Scottish fields. And that was queer fancying well you might say.</p>

<p>But Chae knew nothing of the business, he near knocked in the door of the little house ere he gave it up and went ben the road to Long Rob&#8217;s. And Rob saw him coming and turned off the Mill and ran to meet him, and they sat and argued the rest of the day, Rob brought out his bottle and they had a bit dram; and then Rob made them their supper and they&#8217;d another long dram, and they argued far to the wee, small hours. And Chae swore that he still believed the War would bring a good thing to the world, it would end the armies and fighting forever, the day of socialism at last would dawn, the common folk had seen what their guns could do and right soon they&#8217;d use them when once they came back.</p>

<p>And Rob said <i>Havers, havers. The common folk when they aren&#8217;t sheep are swine, Chae man; you&#8217;re an exception, being a goat.</i></p>

<p>Well, it was fine enough that long arguing with Rob, but out in the dark by the side of Chae as they walked along the road together Rob cried <i>Oh man, I&#8217;d go back with you the morn if only</i>&#8212;and the words fair seemed to stick in his throat. And Chae asked <i>If only, what, man?</i> and Rob said <i>If only I wanted to be easy&#8212;easy and a liar. But I&#8217;ve never gone that gait yet and I&#8217; m damned if I&#8217;ll begin for any bit war!</i></p>

<p>And what he meant by that Chae didn&#8217;t know, he left him then and held over the moor land towards the Knapp under the rising moon. And it was there that a strange thing happened to him, maybe he&#8217;d drunk over much of Long Rob&#8217;s whisky, though his head was steady enough as a rule for thrice the amount he&#8217;d drunk.</p>

<p>Ah well, the thing was this, that as he went over an open space of the vanished Standing Stones he saw right in front of him a halted cart; and a man had got out of the cart and knelt by the axle and looked at it. And Chae thought it some carter billy from the Netherhill taking the near cut through the moor, and steered out to go by and cried <i>Good night, then.</i> But there wasn&#8217;t an answer, so he looked again, and no cart was there, the shingly stones shone white and deserted under the light of the moon, the peewits were crying away in the distance. And Chae&#8217;s hackles fair stood up on end, for it came on him that it was no cart of the countryside he had seen, it was a thing of light wood or basket-work, battered and bent, low behind, with a pole and two ponies yoked to it; and the childe that knelt by the axle had been in strange gear, hardly clad at all, and something had flashed on his head, like a helmet maybe.</p>

<p>And Chae stood and swore, his blood running cold, and near jumping from his skin when a pheasant started under his feet with a screech and a whirr and shot away into the dimness. And maybe it was one of the men of old time that he saw there, a Calgacus&#8217; man from the Graupius battle when they fought the Romans up from the south; or maybe it had only been the power of Long Rob&#8217;s Glenlivet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that was Chae&#8217;s round of the countryside, in a blink his leave was gone and Chae had gone with it, folk said he was still the same old Chae, he blithered still about Rich and Poor, you&#8217;d have thought the Army would have taught him better. But Chris stuck up for him, Chae was fine, not that she herself cared for the Rich and Poor, she was neither one nor the other herself. That year the crops came so thick Ewan said they must hire some help, and that they did, an oldist stock from Bervie he was, gey handless at first, John Brigson his name. But he soon got into the set of Blawearie, sleeping in the room that had once been Chris&#8217;s, and making rare friends with young Ewan, it was lucky they had him. And the harvest came fine and Chris thought it near time that another baby should come to Blawearie. They&#8217;d been careful as blithe in the thing so far, but now it was different. Ewan&#8217;d love to have another.</p>

<p>And one night went on and then another and she whispered to herself <i>In the Spring I&#8217;ll tell him;</i> and the New Year went by; and then news came up to Blawearie in a wave of gossip from all over the Howe. For the Parliament had passed the Conscription Act that meant you&#8217;d to go out and fight whatever you said, they&#8217;d shoot you down if you didn&#8217;t. And sure as death Ewan soon had his papers sent to him, he&#8217;d to go up to Aberdeen and be there examined, he&#8217;d been excused before as a farmer childe. Long Rob got his papers on the very same day and he laughed and said <i>Fine, I&#8217;ll like a bit jaunt.</i></p>

<p>And into Aberdeen they all went, a fair crowd of them then, all in one carriage; and the ploughmen all swore that they didn&#8217;t care a button were they taken or not; and Ewan knew right well that they wouldn&#8217;t take him, they didn&#8217;t take folk that farmed their own land; and Long Rob said nothing, just sat and smoked. So they came to Aberdeen and went to the place and sat in a long, bare room. And a soldier stood near the door of the room and cried out their names one after the other; and Long Rob sat still and smoked his pipe. So they finished at last with the ploughmen childes, the whole jing-bang were passed as soldiers. And they called Long Rob, but he just sat still and smoked his pipe, he wouldn&#8217;t stir out of his jacket, even. So there was a great bit stir at that, they danced around him and swore at him, but he blew his smoke up in their faces, calm like a man unvexed by midges met on a summer day.</p>

<p>They gave up the try, they did nothing to him then, he came back to the Howe and sat down at the Mill. But next he was called to appear at Stonehaven, the Exemption Board sat there for the cases; and Rob rode down on his bicycle, smoking his pipe. So they called out his name and in he went and the Chairman, a wee grocer man that worked night and day to send other folk out to fight the Germans, he asked Long Rob how he liked the idea that folk called him a coward? And Long Rob said <i>Fine, man, fine. I&#8217;d rather any day be a coward than a corpse.</i> And they told him he couldn&#8217;t have exemption and Long Rob lit up his pipe and said that was sad.</p>

<p>Home to the Mill he came again, and that night folk saw him on the round of his parks, standing and smoking and looking at his land and sky, the long rangy childe. Ewan went by fell late that evening and saw him and cried <i>Ay, Rob!</i> but the miller said never a word, Ewan went home to Blawearie vexed about that. But Chris said it was just that Long Rob was thinking of the morn, he&#8217;d been ordered to report to the Aberdeen barracks.</p>

<p>And the next day passed and all Kinraddie watched from its steadings the ingoings and outgoings of Rob at the Mill; and damn the move all the day long did he make to set out as they&#8217;d ordered him. The next day came, the policeman came with it, he rode up to the Mill on his bicycle and bided at the Mill a good two hours and syne rode out again. And folk told later that he&#8217;d spent all that time arguing and prigging at Rob to set out. But Rob said <i>If you want me, carry me!</i> and faith! the policeman couldn&#8217;t very well do that, angered though he was, it would look fair daft wheeling Rob along the roads on his bicycle tail.</p>

<p>So the policeman went off to Stonehaven and out from it late in the evening there drove a gig, the policeman again, and two home-time soldiers, it needed all three to take Rob of the Mill away to the war. He wouldn&#8217;t move even then, though he made no struggle, he just sat still and smoked at his pipe, and they&#8217;d to carry him out and put him in the gig. And off they drove, that was how Long Rob went off to the War, and what happened to him next there rose this rumour and that, some said he was in jail, some said he&#8217;d given in, some said he&#8217;d escaped and was hiding in the hills: but nobody knew for sure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And to Chris it seemed then, Chae gone, Rob gone, that their best friends were out of Kinraddie now, friends close and fine, but they had themselves, Ewan and her and young Ewan. And she held close to them both, working for them, tending them, seeing young Ewan grow straight and strong, with that slim white body of his, like his father&#8217;s just; and it made a strange, sweet dizziness go singing in her heart as she bathed him, he stood so strong and white, she would mind that agony that had been hers at the birth of this body, it had been worth it and more. And now she wanted another bairn, Spring was coming, fast and fast, the land smelt of it, the caller sea winds came fresh with the tang that only in Spring they brought, it was nineteen-seventeen. And Chris said in her heart that in April their baby would be conceived.</p>

<p>So she planned and went singing those days about the kitchen of Blawearie toun, busy with this plot, she planned fresh linen and fresh clothes for herself, she grew young and wayward as before she married, and she looked at Ewan with secret eyes. And old John Brigson would cry <i>Faith, mistress, you&#8217;re light of heart!</i></p>

<p>But Ewan said nothing, strange enough that. She knew then that something troubled him, maybe he was ill and would say nothing about it, sitting so silent at meat and after, it grew worse as the days went on. And when he looked at her no longer was the old look there, but a blank, dark one, and he&#8217;d turn his face from her slowly. She was vexed and then frightened and out in the close one morning, over the stillness of the hen&#8217;s chirawk, she heard his voice raised in cursing at Brigson, it was shameful for him to do that and not like Ewan at all to do it. Then he came back from the steading with quick stepping feet, as he passed through the kitchen Chris cried <i>What&#8217;s wrong?</i> He muttered back <i>Nothing,</i> and went up the stairs, and he took no notice of young Ewan that ran after him, bairn-like, to show him some picture in a book he had.</p>

<p>Chris heard him rummage in their room, and then he came down, he was fully dressed, his dark face heavy and stranger than ever, Chris stared at him <i>Where are you going?</i> and he snapped <i>To Aberdeen, if you&#8217;d like to know,</i> and off he went. He had never spoken to her like that&#8212;he was EWAN, hers! &#8230; She stood at the window, dazed, looking after him, so strange she must then have looked that little Ewan ran to her, <i>Mother, mother!</i> and she picked him up and soothed him and the two of them stood and watched Ewan Tavendale out of sight on the bright spring road.</p>

<p>It seemed to Chris he had hated her that minute when he looked at her in the kitchen, she went through the day with a twist of sickness about her heart. Told Brigson, shamed for her man, she said that Ewan had been worried with his business and that, he&#8217;d been out of his temper that morning and had gone to Aberdeen for the day. And John Brigson said cheerily <i>Never heed, mistress. He&#8217;ll be right as rain when he&#8217;s back the night,</i> and he helped her wash up the supper things, and they had a fine long talk. Syne off he went to tend to the beasts, and Chris grew anxious, looking at the clock, till she minded that there was a later train still, the ten o&#8217;clock train. So she bedded young Ewan and milked the kye, and came back to the kitchen, and waited. John Brigson had gone to his bed, Blawearie was quiet, she went out and walked down to the road to meet Ewan in the fresh-fallen dew of the night&#8212;so young the year and so sweet, she&#8217;d make it this night, the night with Ewan that she&#8217;d planned!</p>

<p>By Peesie&#8217;s Knapp a snipe was sounding, she stood and listened to the bird, and saw in the starlight the skeleton timbers of the great wood that once fronted the north wind there. A hare scuttled over the road, the ditches were running and trilling, hidden, filled with the waters of Spring, she smelt the turned grass of the ploughlands and shivered in the blow of the wind, Ewan was long on the road. At the turnpike bend she stopped and listened for the sound of his feet, and minded a thing out of childhood then, if you put your ear to the ground you&#8217;d hear far off steps long ere you&#8217;d hear them when standing and upright. And she laughed to herself, remembering that, and knelt on the ground, agile and fleet, as the Guthries were, and put close her ear to the road, it was cold and crumbly with little stones. She heard a flock of little sounds going home to their buchts, far and near, each sound went home, but never the sound of a footstep.</p>

<p>And then, Stonehaven way, a great car came flashing down through the night, its headlights leaping from brae to brae, Chris stood back and aside and she saw it go by, there were soldiers in it, one bent on the wheel, she saw the floating ends of his Glengarry bonnet, the car whirled past and was gone in the night. She stared after it, dazed and dreaming, and shivered again. Ewan must have held over the hills and was already at Blawearie, it was daft to be here, he&#8217;d be anxious about her and go out seeking <i>her!</i></p>

<p>So she ran back to Blawearie and she got there panting. But her heart was light, she&#8217;d play a trick on Ewan, creep in on him quiet as quiet, come up behind him sudden in the kitchen and make him jump. And she padded softly across the close to the kitchen door and looked in, and the lamp stood lit on the table, and the place was quiet in its glow. She went up the stairs to their room, there was no sign of Ewan, young Ewan lay sleeping with his face in the pillow, she righted him away from that and went down to the kitchen again. She sat in a chair there, waiting, and her heart froze and froze with the fears that came up in it, she saw Ewan run over by a car in the streets, and why hadn&#8217;t they sent her a telegram?</p>

<p>But maybe she was wrong, maybe he missed the last train and taken one out to Stonehaven instead and was tramping from there in the darkness now. She piled new logs on the fire and sat and waited, and the night went on, she fell fast asleep and waking found the lamp gone out, in the sky between bar and blind was a sharp, dead whiteness like the hand of a corpse. And as she stretched herself, chilled and queer, up in John Brigson&#8217;s room the alarum clock went. It was half-past five, the night had gone, and still Ewan had not come back.</p>

<p>Nor came he back that day, nor many a day beyond that. For the postman at noon brought Chris a letter, it was from Ewan and she sat in the kitchen and read it, and didn&#8217;t understand, and her lip hurt, and she put up the back of her hand to wipe it and looked at the hand and saw blood on it. Young Ewan came playing about her, he took the letter out of her hand and ran off with it, screaming with laughter in his young, shrill voice, she sat and did not look after him and he came back and laughed in her face, surprised that she did not play. And she took him in her arms and asked for the letter again, and again she tried to read it. And what Ewan wrote was he&#8217;d grown sick of it all, folk laughing and sneering at him for a coward, Mutch and Munro aye girding at him. He was off to the War, he had joined the North Highlanders that day, he would let her know where they sent him, she wasn&#8217;t to worry; and <i>I am yours truly Ewan.</i></p>

<p>When John Brigson came in at dinner-time he found Chris looking white as a ghost, but she wasn&#8217;t dazed any longer, it just couldn&#8217;t be helped, Ewan was gone but maybe the war would be over before he had finished with his training. And John Brigson said <i>Of course it will, I see the Germans are retreating on all the fronts, they&#8217;re fair scared white, they say, when our men take to the bayonet.</i> Little Ewan wanted to know what a bayonet was and why the Germans were scared of them, and John Brigson told him and Chris was sick, she&#8217;d to run out to be sick, for if you&#8217;ve ever gutted a rabbit or a hen you can guess what is inside a man, and she&#8217;d seen a bayonet going into Ewan there. And John Brigson was awful sorry, he said he hadn&#8217;t thought, and she wasn&#8217;t to worry, Ewan would be fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, but that Spring was long! Out in the parks in the day-time she&#8217;d go to help John Brigson and ease her weariness, she took little Ewan with her then and a plaid to wrap him in for sleep, under the lithe of a hedge or a whin, when he grew over-tired. And the fields were a comfort, the crumble of the fine earth under your feet, swinging a graip as you walked, breaking dung, the larks above, the horses plodding by with snorting breath, old Brigson a-bend above the shafts. He made fair poor drills, they were better than none, and he aye was pleasant and canty, a fine old stock, he did lots of the things that Ewan had done and asked no more pay for the doing of them. That was as well, he wouldn&#8217;t have got it, the weather was bitter, corn spoiled in the planting.</p>

<p>Early in the year, about May that was, the rain came down and it seemed it never would end, there was nothing to be done out of doors, the rain came down from the north-east across Kinraddie and Chris wasn&#8217;t the only one that noted its difference from other years. In Peesie&#8217;s Knapp there was Mistress Strachan vexing herself in trying to make out the change; and then she minded what Chae had said would happen when the woods came down, once the place had been sheltered and lithe, it poised now upon the brae in whatever storm might come. The woodmen had all finished by then, they&#8217;d left a country that looked as though it had been shelled by a German army. Looking out on those storms that May Chris could hardly believe that this was the place she and Will had watched from the window that first morning they came to Blawearie.</p>

<p>And then the very next day as she made the butter, young Ewan was up the stairs with his blocks and books, John Brigson had gone to Mondynes with a load of corn, Chris heard a step in the close, somebody running in a hurry from the rain. Then the door burst open and a soldier came in, panting, in the queerest uniform, a hat with gold lacing and red breeches and leggings, Chris stared at the hat and then at the face. And the soldier cried <i>Oh, Chris, I believe you don&#8217;t know me!</i> and she cried then, <i>Will!</i> and her arms went round him, they cuddled one the other like children, Chris crying, Will near to crying himself, patting her shoulder and saying <i>Oh, Chris!</i></p>

<p>Then she pushed him away and looked at him and they cuddled each other again and Will danced her all round the kitchen, and little Ewan up the stairs heard the stir and came tearing down and when he saw a strange man holding his mother in his arms he made at Will and whacked his legs and cried, <i>Away, man!</i> Will cried <i>Good God, what&#8217;s this you&#8217;ve got, Chris?</i> and swung Ewan high and stared in his face and shook his head <i>You&#8217;re a fine lad, ay, but you&#8217;re over much of your father in you ever to be as bonny as your mother!</i></p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t true but fine to hear, Chris could hardly get any work done or a meal made ready, so many the things they&#8217;d to take through hand, Will sat and smoked and every now and then they&#8217;d look one at the other and Will would give a great laugh <i>Oh Chris, mind this &#8230; mind that&#8230;!</i> and his laughter had tears in it, they were daft, the pair of them. And when old John Brigson came home, they heard the noise of the wheels in the close and Will went out to lend him a hand, the old stock jumped off the cart and made for a fork that was lying to hand, he thought Will a German in that strange bit uniform. But he laughed right heartily when Will said who he was, and the two of them came in for dinner and Will sat at the table&#8217;s head, in Ewan&#8217;s place. And as he ate he told them how he came in the uniform, and all the chances and wanderings that were his and Mollie&#8217;s when they went from Scotland.</p>

<p>And faith! he&#8217;d had more than enough of both, for in Argentine, as he&#8217;d told Chris already by letter, he&#8217;d left his first work after a while he and Mollie had both learned up the Spanish, and he took a job with a Frenchman there, an awful fine stock. He liked Will well and Will liked him, and he gave Will half of his house to bide in, it was a great ranch out in the parks of that meikle country. So there they had lived and were happy and blithe till the Frenchman had to go to the War. Will had thought of going himself more than once but the Frenchman had told him he&#8217;d be a fair fool, he might well be glad there wasn&#8217;t British conscription; besides, some body or other had to look to the ranch.</p>

<p>But in less than two years the Frenchman came back, sore wounded he&#8217;d been, and soon as he came Will told him it was <i>his</i> turn now, he&#8217;d see some of this War for himself. And the Frenchman told him he was fair a fool, but he&#8217;d get him a job with the French. So he did after cables and cables to Paris, and Will said good-bye to Mollie and the Frenchman and the Frenchman&#8217;s wife, and sailed from Buenos Ayres to Cherbourg; and in Paris they knew all about him, he found himself listed as a sergeant-major in the French Foreign Legion, an interpreter he was, for he knew three languages fine. Then they&#8217;d given him a fortnight&#8217;s leave and here he was.</p>

<p>And when he was alone with Chris that evening and she told him about Ewan down training in Lanark, he said Ewan was either soft or daft or both. <i>Why did you marry the dour devil, Chris? Did he make you or were you going to have a bairn?</i> And Chris didn&#8217;t feel affronted, it was Will that asked, he&#8217;d treat her just the same if she owned up to a fatherless bairn once a year, or twice, if it came to that. So she shook her head, <i>It was just because he was to me as Mollie to you,</i> and Will nodded to that, <i>Ah, well, we can&#8217;t help when it gets that way. Mind when you wanted to know &#8230;?</i></p>

<p>And they stood and laughed in the evening, remembering that, and they walked arm in arm up and down the road and Chris forgot all her worries remembering the days when she and Will were bairns together, and the dourness and the loveliness then, and Will asked <i>Do you mind when we slept together&#8212;that last time we did it when the old man had near killed me up in the barn?</i> And his face grew dark, he still couldn&#8217;t forgive, he said that folk who ill-treated their children deserved to be shot, father had tormented and spoiled him out of sheer cruelty when he was young. But Chris said nothing to that, remembering the day of father&#8217;s funeral and how she had wept by his grave in Kinraddie kirkyard.</p>

<p>But she knew she could never tell Will of that, he&#8217;d never understand, and they spoke of other things, Will of the Argentine and the life out there, and the smell of the sun and the warm weather and the fruit and flowers and flame of life below the Southern Cross. Chris said <i>But you&#8217;ll come back, you and Mollie, to bide in Scotland again?</i> and Will laughed, he seemed still a mere lad in spite of his foreign French uniform, <i>Havers, who&#8217;d want to come back to this country? It&#8217;s dead or it&#8217;s dying&#8212;and a damned good job!</i></p>

<p>And, daftly, Chris felt a sudden thrust of anger through her heart at that; and then she looked round Kinraddie in the evening light, seeing it so quiet and secure and still, thinking of the seeds that pushed up their shoots from a thousand earthy mouths. Daft of Will to say that: Scotland lived, she could never die, the land would outlast them all, their wars and their Argentines, and the winds come sailing over the Grampians still with their storms and rain and the dew that ripened the crops&#8212;long and long after all their little vexings in the evening light were dead and done. And her thoughts went back to the kirkyard, she asked Will would he like to come to the kirk next day, she hadn&#8217;t been there herself for a year.</p>

<p>He looked surprised and then laughed <i>You&#8217;re not getting religious, are you?</i> as though she had taken to drink. And Chris said <i>No,</i> and then thought about that, time to think for once in the pother of the days with Blawearie so quiet above them, young Ewan and old Brigson asleep. And she said <i>I don&#8217;t believe they were ever religious, the Scots folk. Will&#8212;not really religious like Irish or French or all the rest in the history books. They&#8217;ve never BELIEVED. It&#8217;s just been a place to collect and argue, the kirk, and criticise God.</i> And Will yawned, he said maybe, he didn&#8217;t care one way or the other himself, Mollie in the Argentine had taken up with the Catholics, and faith! she was welcome if she got any fun.</p>

<p>So next day they set out for the kirk, the weather had cleared, blowing wet and sunny in a blink, there were teeth of rainbows out over Kinraddie, Chris said it was Will&#8217;s uniform that messed up the sky. But she was proud of him for all that, how folk stared as the two of them went down the aisle! Chris was in her blue, with her new short skirt and long boots, and Will in <i>his</i> blue and red trousers and leggings, and his jacket with the gold lace on it and the high collar and the soft fine hat with the shiny peak. Old Gibbon, him that preached for his son, near fell down the stairs of the pulpit at sight of Will. But he recovered fell soon and preached them one of the sermons that had made such stir throughout the Howe a year or so back, he told how the German beasts now boiled the corpses of their own dead men and fed the leavings to pigs. And he ground his teeth at the Germans, they were so coarse; and he said that GUD would assuredly smite them.</p>

<p>But folk had grown sick of him and his ragings, there was only a small attendance to hear him and when they came out in the end Will said <i>It&#8217;s good to be out of that creature&#8217;s stink!</i> Syne Ellison recognised Will and came swaggering over, redder than ever and fatter than ever, and he cried <i>If it ain&#8217;t Will Guthrie! How are you?</i> and Will said <i>Fine.</i> Most of the folk seemed pleased to see him, even Mutch and Munro, excepting the Munro wife herself, she snapped, <i>And what would you be, then Will? They&#8217;ve a man at the picture palace in Stonehaven that wears breeks just like that.</i> And Will said <i>Faith, Mistress Munro, you&#8217;re an authority on breeks. I hear you still wear them at the Cuddiestoun.</i> Folk standing round gave a snicker at that, real fine for the futret, she&#8217;d met her match.</p>

<p>And Will&#8217;s leave went by like a shot, he was all over the Howe in the first few days, up in Fordoun and down in Drumlithie, and everywhere folk made much of him. But after that he bided nearly all the time by Chris, he helped her or Brigson in old clothes of Ewan&#8217;s she&#8217;d raked out for him. He went shooting with father&#8217;s gun fell often, up in the moor it was blithe to hear him and his singing, young Ewan would go wandering up to meet him. And when it came to the end and the last day, young Ewan in bed and they sat by the fire and the June night came softly down without, Chris didn&#8217;t fear at all for Will, he was clean and happy and quick, things went well with him. And next morning only young Ewan cried at the parting, and off he went, it seemed then at Blawearie that more than Will had gone out of their lives, it was a happy voice that had sung for itself a chamber in their hearts those weeks he had been with them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the hills flowed up and down, day after day, in their dark and sunshine, and even those weeks were covered and laid past, and Chris saw the harvest near, so near, a good harvest again in spite of the weather; and still the War went on. Sometimes she&#8217;d a note or postcard from Ewan in Lanark, sometimes she wouldn&#8217;t hear for week on week till she grew fair alarmed. But he just said it was that he never could write, he didn&#8217;t know how, they were awfully busy and she wasn&#8217;t to worry.</p>

<p>And then through Kinraddie a motor came driving one day, it turned at the cross-roads and drove down by the Denburn. It stopped at the Mill and folk ran to their doors and wondered who it could be, the place was locked up and deserted-like. And when the motor stopped a man got out, and another came after, slow, and he took the arm of the first one, and they went step-stepping at snail&#8217;s pace up to the Mill-house and folk could see no more. But soon the story of it was known all over the place, it was Long Rob himself come back, he had never given in, they had put him in prison and ill-used him awful; but he wouldn&#8217;t give in whatever they did, he laughed in their faces, <i>Fine, man, fine.</i> Last he went on the hunger-strike, that was when you just starved to death to spite them, and grew weaker and weaker. So they took him from prison to a doctor childe and the doctor said it was useless to keep him, he&#8217;d never be of use to his King and country.</p>

<p>So home at last he had come, folk told he was fairly a wreck, he could hardly stand up and walk or make his own meat, God knows how he ever got into his clothes. And Mutch and Munro wouldn&#8217;t go near him, neither would Gordon, they said that it served him right, the coarse pro-German. And when Chris heard that there came a stinging pain in her eyes and she called old John Brigson to yoke a cart and put corn in it, as though taking it to Rob for bruising; and Chris got into the cart as well and took young Ewan on her knee, and off they set from Blawearie. Outside the Mill-house Chris cried on Brigson to stop, and found the basket she&#8217;d laid on the bottom of the cart and ran through the close to the kitchen door. It stood half-open, the place was dark with hardly a glimmer from the fire, but she saw someone sitting, she stopped and stared, an old man it seemed with a white, drawn face, his hands fumbling at the lighting of a pipe.</p>

<p>She called <i>Rob!</i> and he looked up and she saw his eyes, they were filled with awful things, he cried <i>Chris! God is&#8217;t Chris Guthrie?</i> She was shaking his hand and his shoulder then, minding things about him, not looking at him, minding the fine neighbour he&#8217;d been to her and Ewan in the days they married. And she asked <i>What are you sitting here for! You should be in your bed,</i> and Rob said <i>I&#8217;m damned if I should, I&#8217;ve had over much of bed. I was waiting about for the grocer childe, but he didn&#8217;t stop, though he knows I&#8217;m home. I suppose he&#8217;s still an ill-will at pro-Germans, like.</i></p>

<p>Chris told him never to mind the grocer, and she spoke to him roughly, in case she should weep at the sight of him; and she told him to go out and see John Brigson. Then, soon as he&#8217;d hirpled out with his stick she looked round the place and started to clean it, and made a fine fire and a meal with fresh eggs and butter, and oat-cakes and scones and jam, she&#8217;d brought the lot from Blawearie. So when Rob came in from his speak with Brigson, there it was waiting for him on the table, he blinked and sat down and said in a whisper, <i>You shouldn&#8217;t have done this, Chris quean.</i> But Chris said nothing, just sat him down at the table and sat there herself and saw that he ate; and when young Ewan came in with old Brigson she fed them as well; and syne Brigson set off for the farm at Auchenblae where Rob&#8217;s horse and sholtie were housed.</p>

<p>When he&#8217;d gone Chris set to work on the place and opened the windows to the air and cleaned out the rooms and dragged off the dirty linen from the bed and made it up in a bundle to take back with her. Syne she baked oat-cakes for Rob and told him that each day he&#8217;d get him a pail of milk from the Netherhill, till time came when he&#8217;d kye of his own again, she&#8217;d arranged for that. And when John Brigson came back in the evening with horse and sholtie Long Rob was fast asleep in his chair, they didn&#8217;t rouse him but spread him his supper, and set him his breakfast as well, and left a lamp low-burning and clear beside him, and a hot-water bottle in his bed. Syne they left him and rode them back to Blawearie, all three were tired, young Ewan asleep in the arms of Chris, dear to hold him so with his dark head sleeping against her breast and old Brigson&#8217;s shoulder seen as a dark quiet bulking against the night.</p>

<p>Next morning they looked out from Blawearie and saw Rob&#8217;s horse and sholtie at graze in a park of the Mill, and Long Rob himself, a dot in the sunlight, making slow way to the moor land he&#8217;d wrought at so long. And as they looked they heard, thin and remote, the sound of a song Kinraddie had missed for many a day. It was <i>Ladies of Spain.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon maybe the War would end, Chris had dreamt as she listened to that singing, and they all be back in Kinraddie as once they had been, Chae and Long Rob and her dark lad, Ewan himself. So she&#8217;d dreamt that morning, she&#8217;d never grow out from long dreaming in autumn dawns like those. And fruition of dream came soon enough, it was a telegram boy that came riding his bicycle up to Blawearie. Chris read the telegram, it was Ewan that had sent it, <i>Home on leave to-night before going to France.</i> She stared at it and the lad that had brought it, and he asked, <i>Any reply?</i> and she said <i>Any what?</i> and he asked her again, and she said <i>No,</i> and ran into the kitchen and stared at the writing in the telegram. He was going to France.</p>

<p>It lingered at the back of her mind, dark, like a black cat creeping at the back of a hedge, she saw the fluff of its fur or the peek of its eyes, a wild and sinister thing in the sunlight; but you would not look often or see those eyes, how they glared at you. He was going out there, where the sky was a troubled nightmare and the earth shook night and day, into the lands of the coarse French folk, her Ewan, her lad with his dark, dear face and that quick, blithe blush. And suddenly she was filled with a weeping pity in her heart for him, a pity that brought no tears to her eyes, he must never see her shed tears all the time he was with her, he&#8217;d go out to the dark, far land with memories of her and Blawearie that were shining and brave and kind.</p>

<p>So all the forenoon she fled and bustled from room to room, brightening the place, she brought out fresh sheets and pillows for the bed she had found so lonely, she sent out young Ewan to gather roses and honeysuckle to set in a jar on the ledge above the bed. And she hung new curtains there and brought out Ewan&#8217;s clothes and brushed them, he&#8217;d want to get out of his uniform, they were sick of the khaki the men that came back. Then she made a great baking against his coming, so much that she&#8217;d hardly time to make dinner for young Ewan and Brigson, but they didn&#8217;t care, they were both excited as herself. She knew the train he would come by, the half-past five, and she swept and dusted the kitchen and set his tea, and punched a great cushion ready for his chair, and dressed herself in the blue he liked and young Ewan in his brave brown cords. John Brigson cried <i>This is hardly the place</i> <i>for me with your man come home, I&#8217;ll away to Bervie then for the night.</i></p>

<p>Off he set, Chris waved to the old, kind childe as he bicycled down Blawearie brae. And then she ran back, ben to the parlour to look at herself in the mirror again, in the long glass her figure seemed blithe and slim even still, she&#8217;d be fine to sleep with yet, she supposed&#8212;oh, Ewan! Her face hadn&#8217;t changed, it was flushed and fair, the eyes maybe older, but shining and bright. And she finished with that looking and went over the close to stand by the side of young Ewan, looking down the hill for his father coming up. The sun flung the long shadows of Blawearie and the beeches far in the east, and across the Den, high in the fields of Upperhill, a lost sheep baaed in the whins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had hardly been able to believe it him lying awake after he slept, he slept with a snoring breath and fuddled mumblings, bulging out against her so that she had but little of the bed and less of the blankets. She closed her eyes and pressed her knuckles against her teeth that the pain might waken her, that she might know Ewan hadn&#8217;t come home, was still the same Ewan she&#8217;d dreamt of in the silence of the night and her own lonely bed. But he moved, flinging out an arm that struck her across the face, she lay still below it, then it wabbled away. She took her knuckles from her mouth and lay quiet then, no need for her to hurt herself now.</p>

<p>Drunk he had come from the station and more than two hours late. Standing at last in the kitchen in his kilts he&#8217;d looked round and sneered <i>Hell, Chris, what a bloody place!</i> as she ran to him. And he&#8217;d flung his pack one way and his hat the other and kissed her as though she were a tink, his hands on her as quickly as that, hot and questing and wise as his hands had never been. She saw the hot smoulder fire in his eyes then, but no blush on his face, it was red with other things. But she smothered her horror and laughed, and kissed him and struggled from him, and cried <i>Ewan, who&#8217;s this!</i></p>

<p>Young Ewan held back, shy-like, staring, and just said <i>It&#8217;s father.</i> At that the strange, swaying figure in the tartan kilts laughed, coarse-like, <i>Well, we&#8217;ll hope so, eh Chris? Any supper left&#8212;unless you&#8217;re too bloody stand-offish even to have that?</i></p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t believe her own ears. <i>Stand-offish? Oh, Ewan!</i> and ran to him again, but he shook her away, <i>Och, all right, I&#8217;m wearied. For God&#8217;s sake let a man sit down.</i> He staggered to the chair she&#8217;d made ready for him, a picture-book of young Ewan&#8217;s lay there, he picked the thing up and flung it to the other side of the room, and slumped down into the chair. <i>Hell, what a blasted climb to a blasted place. Here, give us some tea.</i></p>

<p>She sat beside him to serve him, she knew her face had gone white. But she poured the tea and spread the fine supper she&#8217;d been proud to make, it might hardly have been there for the notice he paid it, drinking cup after cup of the tea like a beast at a trough. She saw him clearer then, the coarse hair that sprang like short bristles all over his head, the neck with its red and angry circle about the collar of the khaki jacket, a great half-healed scar across the back of his hand glinted putrescent blue. Suddenly his eyes came on her, <i>Well, damn&#8217;t, is that all you&#8217;ve to say to me now I&#8217;ve come home? I&#8217;d have done better to spend the night with a tart in the town.</i></p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t say anything, she couldn&#8217;t, the tears were choking in her throat and smarting and biting at her eyelids, pressing to come, the tears that she&#8217;d sworn she&#8217;d never shed all the time he was home on leave. And she didn&#8217;t dare look at him lest he should see, but he saw and pushed back his chair and got up in a rage, <i>Good God, what are you snivelling about now? You always were snivelling, I mind.</i> And out he went, young Ewan ran to her side and flung his arms round her, <i>Mother, don&#8217;t cry, I don&#8217;t like him, he&#8217;s a tink, that soldier!</i> She&#8217;d pressed back the tears then, <i>Whist, Ewan, never say that again;</i> and got up and cleared off the supper things and went out to the close and cried gently <i>Ewan!</i></p>

<p>He cried back <i>All right, all right!</i> still angrily; and at that some anger kindled within herself, she didn&#8217;t wait for him to come back but turned and took young Ewan in her arms and climbed the stairs and put him to bed, he was vexed and troubled about her, kissing her as he lay there. <i>Sleep with me to-night, mother.</i> She laughed at him, she was sleeping with his father to-night, he must be good and sleep himself, quick and quick, there&#8217;d be such fun with father the morn. He said <i>I&#8217;ll try,</i> and closed his eyes and she went down the stairs, it was dark there getting on for eight. She thought Ewan was still outside but as she made for the lamp something stirred in the chair, she thought it a cat, it was Ewan. He caught her and pulled her on to his knees and said <i>Be stand-offish now if you can, what the devil do you think I&#8217;ve come home for?</i></p>

<p>It had been like struggling with someone deep in a nightmare, when the blankets are over your head and you can barely breathe, awful she should come to think that of Ewan. But it wasn&#8217;t Ewan, her Ewan, someone coarse and strange and strong had come back in his body to torment her. He laughed as he fought her there in the chair and held her tight and began to tell stories&#8212;oh, he was drunk and didn&#8217;t know what he said, terrible and sickening things, he&#8217;d had women when he pleased in Lanark, he said. And he whispered of them to her, his breath was hot on her face, she saw the gleam of his teeth, he told her how he&#8217;d lain with them and the things he&#8217;d done. Sickened and shamed she had felt and then worse than that, stopping from struggling, a shameful, searing desire come on her. And he knew, he knew at once, he said <i>Well, now that you know you can get!</i></p>

<p>She had picked herself up from the floor and in a dream went out to milk the kye, leaving him there. When she came back he had gone from the kitchen, she was slow to finish sieving and skimming the milk and go up to the room she&#8217;d made ready that morning, singing she had made it ready. And up there he waited her, lying in the bed, he&#8217;d carried up a lamp from the kitchen, they who&#8217;d always gone to bed in the darkness and thought it fine to lie in each other&#8217;s arms in the night-glimmer from the window. But now he grumbled <i>For God&#8217;s sake hurry up!</i> and when she made to put out the light&#8212;<i>I&#8217;ll do that, come on!</i> And she lay beside him and he took her.</p>

<p>She remembered that now, lying in the darkness the while he slept, why he had left the lamp alight; and at memory of that foulness something cold and vile turned and turned like a wheeling mirror inside her brain. For it had been other things than his beast-like mauling that had made her whisper in agony, <i>Oh Ewan, put out the light!</i> The horror of his eyes upon her she would never forget, they burned and danced on that mirror that wheeled and wheeled in her brain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that was Ewan&#8217;s homecoming on leave and the days that went by were the same as that first night foreshadowed. He had gone away Ewan Tavendale, he came back a man so coarse and cruel that in place of love hate came singing in the heart of Chris&#8212;hate that never found speech, that but slowly found lodgement secure and unshaken. For often it seemed to her that a tortured, tormented thing looked out from Ewan&#8217;s eyes while he told them his foulest tale, ill-used old Brigson and jeered at him, came drunken back to Blawearie night after night&#8212;that tortured thing that was the lost lad she had married. But the fancy wilted and vanished as the days went by. He stayed five days, had his breakfast in bed, and never got up till dinner-time; he never looked at the parks or stock or took notice of young Ewan; he dressed in his khaki and kilts alone, and to Chris&#8217;s suggestion that he wear a suit&#8212;<i>What, me, dress up like bloody conchy? I&#8217;ll leave that to your friend, Rob Duncan.</i></p>

<p>Every day he went swaggering down the road and was off to Drumlithie or Stonehaven or Fordoun, drinking there. Before he went he&#8217;d ask for money, Chris gave him all that he asked, not saying a word, but he&#8217;d fancy a reluctance and sneer at her. Wasn&#8217;t he entitled to what was his own? Did she think him still the young fool he had been, content to slave and slave at Blawearie&#8212;<i>without as much as a dram to savour the soss, or a quean or so at night to waken your blood&#8212;nothing but a wife you hardly dared touch in case you put her in the family way, eh, Chris?</i></p>

<p>He would say this at dinner-time, sneering and boasting, old Brigson would colour and look down at his plate and young Ewan stare and stare at his father till Ewan would say <i>God, what a damned glower! Eyes like your mother and a nature the same;</i> and he&#8217;d swear at the bairn, it was shameful to hear that. He&#8217;d made friends with Mutch, him that once he could hardly abide, and with him he went driving each night on their drunken sprees. As he went to bed John Brigson would look at Chris with trouble in his kind old eyes, but she didn&#8217;t dare say a thing to him, he&#8217;d go stamping slow up above her head the while she sat down to await Ewan&#8217;s return and have the hirpling note of the clock stamp each second in her heart, hating him home, wanting him home.</p>

<p>For after that first night he had ceased to touch her, she would lie beside him, quivering and waiting. And he&#8217;d lie quiet, she knew him awake and knew that he knew what she waited; and it was as though he were a cat that played with a mouse, he would laugh out after a while and then go to sleep, she herself to lie tortured in the hours thereafter. The last night she refused the torment, she got up near three o&#8217;clock and kindled a fire and made herself tea and watched the morning come down the hill passes&#8212;a fine summer morning, yellow and grey and lovely with its chirping of birds in the beeches. And suddenly then, as always these changes took her, she was calm and secure, putting Ewan from her heart, locking it up that he never could vex her again, she was finished with him, either loving or hating. And at that release she rose and went slow about her work, a great load had gone from her then, John Brigson coming down in the morning heard her sing and was cheery himself, cheery with relief, but she sang her release.</p>

<p>At nine o&#8217;clock Ewan cried down from his room <i>When the hell are you bringing some breakfast?</i> She took no notice of that, but she sent young Ewan out to play and then went on with her work. And at last she heard a clatter on the stairs, and there he stood at the kitchen entrance, glaring at her, <i>Have you gone clean deaf?</i> She answered him then, raising her head and looking at him, <i>If you&#8217;re in need of a breakfast&#8212;get it.</i></p>

<p>He said <i>You bitch!</i> and he made to strike her. But she caught up a knife from the table, she had it waiting there nearby, he swore and drew back. She nodded and smiled at that, calm, and put the knife down and went on with her work.</p>

<p>So he made his own tea, grumbling and swearing, a fine send-off this for a man that was going to France to do his bit. And Chris listened to the catch-phrase, contempt in her heart, she looked at him with curling lip, and he saw her look and swore at her, but was frightened for all that, always now she knew she had known him the frightened one. And a queer, cold curiosity came on to her then that so she should have slaved to tend him and love him and give him the best, body and mind and soul she had given, for a gift to the body of a drunken lout from the plough-stilts.</p>

<p>And now that body she saw with a cold repulsion him wash and shave and dress, she could hardly bear to look at him and went out and worked in the close, cleaning pots there in the shining weather, young Ewan played douce and content with his toys, it was hay-time all down the Howe and the hens came pecking around her. She heard Ewan stamp about in the kitchen, he wanted that she should look, go running and fetch him his things. And she smiled again, cold and secure and serene, and heard him come out and bang the door; and without raising her head she saw him then. He was all in his gear, the Glengarry on his head, his pack on his shoulder, his kilts a-swing, and he went past her jauntily, but she knew he expected her to stop him, to run after him and throw her arms about him: she saw in his eyes as he went by the fear that she&#8217;d pay no heed.</p>

<p>And none she paid, she did not speak, she did not unbend, young Ewan stopped from his playing and looked after his father incuriously, as at a strange alien that went from the place. At the gate of the close, as he banged it behind him, Ewan stooped to sort up his garters, red in the face, not looking at her still. And she paid him no heed.</p>

<p>He swung the pack on his shoulders then and went slow down the road to the turnpike bend, she saw that from the kitchen window, knew he believed she would cry to him at the last. And she smiled, cold and sure, that she knew him so, every action and thought, and why he stood there at last, not trying to look back. He fumbled for matches and lighted his pipe as she watched; and a cloud came over the sun and went on with Ewan, the two of them went down the turnpike then together, out of her sight in the shadow and flame of the bright sun weather, it was strange and impossibly strange. She stood long staring down at that point where he&#8217;d vanished, sharp under her breast, tearing her body, her heart was breaking, and she did not care! She was outside and away from its travail and agony, he had done all to her that he ever could now, he who had tramped down the road in that shadow that fled from the sun.</p>

<p>And then it was she found no salvation at all may endure for ever, or beyond the pitch that the heart may bear it, she was weeping and weeping, her arms flung over the kitchen table, weeping for that Ewan who had never come back, for the shamed, tormented boy with the swagger airs she had let go from Blawearie without a kiss or a parting word. <i>Ewan, Ewan!</i> her heart cried then, breaking and breaking, <i>Oh, Ewan, I didn&#8217;t mean it!</i> Ewan&#8212;he was hers, hers still in spite of all he had done and said, he had lived more closely in her body than the heart that broke now, young Ewan was his, Oh God, she had never let him go like that! And in her desolation of weeping she began to pray, she had known it useless, but she prayed and prayed for him to come back, to kiss her and hold her in kindness just once before he went down that road. She ran wild-eyed and weeping to the close and there was John Brigson, he stared dumbfounded as she cried <i>Oh, don&#8217;t let him go, run after him, John!</i></p>

<p>And syne he said he didn&#8217;t understand, if she meant her man, it was more than an hour since Ewan had gone down the road, he&#8217;d heard long syne the whistle of his train out across the hills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a month before she heard from him, and then only a scrape and a score on a thing they called a field postcard written somewhere in France; and it said no more than that he was well. No more than a whisper out of the dark cave of days into which he had gone, it yet salved her mind from the searing agony that tormented the early weeks. They would never be the same again, but some day he would come back to her, their madness forgotten, back to her and young Ewan and Blawearie when the War was done, they&#8217;d forget and forget, busy themselves in new hours and seasons, there would never be fire and gladness between them again but still undying the labour of the fields in which she now buried her days.</p>

<p>For she sank herself in that, the way to forget, she was hardly indoors from dawn to dusk, in all the range of the harvest weather, running down the bouts behind the binder that John Brigson drove, little Ewan running and laughing beside her. He thought it a fun and a play she made, stooking and stooking so quickly then, her hands became as machines, tireless and quick and ceaseless through the long hours, she stooked so quickly that with an extra hour each evening, old Brigson helping her, she was close to the uncut rigs again. Corn and the shining hollow stalks of the straw, they wove a pattern about her life, her nights and days, she would creep to bed and dream of the endless rigs and her hands in the night would waken her, all pins and needles they would be. Once she went ben to the parlour to look in the glass and saw then why pity came often in old Brigson&#8217;s eyes, she was thinner than ever she&#8217;d been, her face was thin, it seemed to her some gloss had gone from her hair, her eyes grown dull and patient and pupil-less; like the eyes of a cow.</p>

<p>So, hurt and dazed, she turned to the land, close to it and the smell of it, kind and kind it was, it didn&#8217;t rise up and torment your heart, you could keep at peace with the land if you gave it your heart and hands, tended it and slaved for it, it was wild and a tyrant, but it was not cruel. And often, in the night-stooking with old John Brigson near, a ghost of gladness would come to her then, working under the coming of the moon before the evening dew came pringling over Kinraddie, night-birds whistling over the fields, so quiet, so quiet, stilling away the pain in her body, the pain in her heart that this reaping and harvesting had brought.</p>

<p>And then Long Rob of the Mill came up to Blawearie. He came one morning as they started the yavil, he came through the close and into the kitchen, long and as rangy as ever he was, his face filled out and his eyes the same, and he cried <i>How&#8217;s Chris? Bonny as ever!</i> And he caught young Ewan up on his shoulder and Ewan looked down at him, dark and grave, and smiled, and thought him fine.</p>

<p>Rob had come over to help, he&#8217;d no cutting to do; and when Chris said nay, he mustn&#8217;t leave the Mill, he twinkled his eyes and shook his head. And Chris knew he&#8217;d have little loss, folk changed and were changing again, not a soul had driven his corn cart to the Mill since Long Rob came back. He&#8217;d had nothing to do but pleiter about from park to park and look out on the road for the custom that never came; and if any came now it could damn well wait, he&#8217;d come up to stook Blawearie.</p>

<p>So the two went down to the park, young Ewan went with them, and they stooked it together, the best of the crop, Rob cheery as ever it seemed to Chris. But sometimes his eyes would wander up to the hills, like a man seeking a thing he had never desired, and into the iron-blue eyes a shadow like a dark, quiet question would creep. Maybe he minded the jail and its torments then, he spoke never of that, and never a word of the War, nor Chris, all the stooking of the yavil park. Strange she had hardly known him before, Long Rob of the Mill, unco and atheist; he&#8217;d been only the miller with the twinkling eyes, his singings by morn and his whistlings by night, his stories of horses till your head fair reeled. Now it seemed she had known him always, closely and queerly, she felt queer, as though shy, when she sat by his side at the supper table and he spoke to old Brigson that night. The pallor of the jail came out in the lamp-light, under the brown that the sun had brought, and she saw his hand by the side of her hand, thin and strong, the miller&#8217;s horse-taming hand.</p>

<p>He bedded young Ewan that night, for a play, and sung him to sleep, Chris and old Brigson heard the singing as they sat in the kitchen below, <i>Ladies of Spain</i> and <i>There was a Young Farmer</i> and <i>A&#8217; the Blue Bonnets are Over the Border.</i> Hardly anybody left in Kinraddie sang these songs, it was full of other tunes from the bothy windows now, <i>Tipperary</i> and squawling English things, like the squeak of a rat that is bedded in syrup, the <i>Long, Long Trail</i> and the like. It was queer and eerie, listening to Rob, like listening to an echo from far in the years at the mouth of a long lost glen.</p>

<p>And she never knew when and how in the days that followed, it came on her silently, secretly, out of the earth itself, maybe, the knowledge she was Rob&#8217;s to do with as he willed, she willed. She wanted more than the clap of his hand on her shoulder as they finished the bout at evening and up through the shadows took their slow way, by parkside and dyke, to the close that hung drenched with honeysuckle smell. She wanted more than his iron-blue eye turned on her, warm and clean and kind though she felt her skin colour below that gaze, she wanted those things that now all her life she came to know she had never known&#8212;a man to love her, not such a boy as the Ewan that had been or the poor demented beast he&#8217;d become.</p>

<p>And if old John Brigson guessed of those things that whispered so shamelessly there in her heart he gave never a sign, wise and canny and kind. And no sign that he knew did Rob give either, swinging by her side in the harvest that drew to its end. And in Chris as she bent and straightened and stooked the last day was a prayer to the earth and fields, a praying that this harvest might never end, that she and Long Rob would tramp it forever. But the binder flashed its blades at the head of the last, long bout, and Long Rob had his hand on her shoulder, <i>He&#8217;s finished, Chris quean, and it&#8217;s clyak!</i></p>

<p>That evening she went out with him to the gate of the close, and he swung his coat on his shoulder, <i>Well, well, Chris lass, I&#8217;ve liked this fine.</i> And then, not looking at her, he added <i>I&#8217;m away to Aberdeen to enlist the morn.</i></p>

<p>For a moment she was stupefied and stared at him silently, but she had no place in his thoughts, he was staring across Kinraddie&#8217;s stooked fields. And then he began to tell her, he&#8217;d resolved on this days before, he couldn&#8217;t stay out of it longer, all the world had gone daft and well he might go with the rest, there was neither trade nor trust for him here, or rest ever again till this War was over, if it ever ended at all. <i>So I&#8217;m giving in at last, I suppose they&#8217;ll say. And this is ta-ta, Chris; mind on me kindly some times.</i></p>

<p>She held to his hand in the gloaming light and so he looked down at last, she was biting her lips to keep down the tears, but he saw them shine brimming then in her eyes. And his own changed, changed and were kind and then something else, he cried <i>Why, lass!</i> and his hand on her shoulder drew her close, she was close and against him, held tight so that she felt the slow beat of his heart, she wanted to rest there, safe and safe in these corded arms. And then she minded that to-morrow he&#8217;d be gone, it cried through the evening in every cry of the lapwings, <i>So near, so near!</i></p>

<p>So this also ended as everything else, every thing she had ever loved and desired went out to the madness beyond the hills on that ill road that flung its evil white ribbon down the dusk. And it was her arms then that went round his neck, drawing down his head and kissing him, queer and awful to kiss a man so, kissing him till she heard his breath come quick, and he gripped her, pleading with her, <i>We&#8217;re daft, Chris quean, we mustn&#8217;t!</i> But she knew then she had won, she wound her arms about him, she whispered <i>The haystacks!</i> and he carried her there, the smell of the clover rose crushed and pungent and sweet from under her head; and lying so in the dark, held to him, kissing him, she sought with lips and limbs and blood to die with him then.</p>

<p>But that dark, hot cloud went by, she found herself still lying there, Rob was there, and she drew his head to her breast, lying so with him, seeing out below the rounded breasts of the haystacks the dusky red of the harvest night, this harvest gathered to herself at last, reaped and garnered and hers in her heart and body. So they were for hours, John Brigson never called out to them; and then she stood beside Rob at the head of the road again, drowsy and quiet and content. They made no promises, kissing for last, she knew already he was growing remote from her, his eyes already remote to that madness that beckoned beyond the hills. So it was that he went from her next, she heard him go step-stepping slow with that swinging stride of his down through the darkness, and she never saw him again, was never to see him again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It had burned up as a fire in a whin-bush, that thing in her life, and it burned out again and was finished. She went about the Blawearie biggings next day singing under breath to herself, quiet and unvexed, tending to hens and kye, seeing to young Ewan&#8217;s sleep in the day and the setting of old Brigson&#8217;s supper ere he came at night. She felt shamed not at all, all the vexing fears had gone from her, she made no try to turn from the eyes in the glass that looked out at her, wakened and living again. She was glad she&#8217;d gone out with Long Rob, glad and content, they were one and the same now, Ewan and her.</p>

<p>So the telegram boy that came riding to Blawearie found her singing there in the close, mending young Ewan&#8217;s clothes. She heard the click of the gate and he took the telegram out of his wallet and gave it to her and she stared at him and then at her hands. They were quivering like the leaves of the beech in the forecoming of rain, they quivered in a little mist below her eyes. Then she opened the envelope and read the words and she said there was no reply, the boy swung on his bicycle again and rode out, riding and leaning he clicked the gate behind him; and laughed back at her for the cleverness of that.</p>

<p>She stood up then, she put down her work on the hackstock and read again in the telegram, and began to speak to herself till that frightened her and she stopped. But she forgot to be frightened, in a minute she was speaking again, the chirawking hens in the close stopped and came near and turned up bright eyes to her loud and toneless whispering, <i>What do I do&#8212;oh, what do I do?</i></p>

<p>She was vexed and startled by that&#8212;what was it she did! Did she go out to France and up to the front line, maybe, into a room where they&#8217;d show her Ewan lying dead, quiet and dead, white and bloodless, sweat on his hair, killed in action? She went out to the front door and waved to the harvesters, Brigson, young Ewan, and a tink they&#8217;d hired, they saw her and stared till she waved again and then John Brigson abandoned the half-loaded cart and came waddling up the park, so slow he was, <i>Did you cry me, Chris?</i></p>

<p>Sweat on his hair as sweat on Ewan&#8217;s. She stared at that and held out the telegram, he wiped slow hands and took it and read it, while she clung to the door-post and whispered and whispered <i>What is it I do now, John? Have I to go out to France?</i> And at last he looked up, his face was grizzled and hot and old, he wiped the sweat from it slow. <i>God, mistress, this is sore news, but he&#8217;s died like a man out there, your Ewan&#8217;s died fine.</i></p>

<p>But she wouldn&#8217;t listen to that, wanting to know the thing she must do; and not till he told her that she did nothing, they could never take all the widows to France and Ewan must already be buried, did she stop from that twisting of her hands and ceaseless whisper. Then anger came, <i>Why didn&#8217;t you tell me before? Oh, damn you, you liked tormenting me!</i> and she turned from him into the house and ran up the stairs to the bed, the bed that was hers and Ewan&#8217;s, and lay on it, and put her hands over her ears trying not to hear a cry of agony in a lost French field, not to think that the body that had lain by hers, frank and free and kind and young, was torn and dead and unmoving flesh, blood twisted upon it, not Ewan at all, riven and terrible, still and dead when the harvest stood out in Blawearie&#8217;s land and the snipe were calling up on the loch and the beech trees whispered and rustled. And <i>SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS A LIE!</i></p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t dead, he could never have died or been killed for nothing at all, far away from her over the sea, what matter to him their War and their fighting, their King and their country? Kinraddie was his land, Blawearie his, he was never dead for those things of no concern, he&#8217;d the crops to put in and the loch to drain and her to come back to. It had nothing to do with Ewan this telegram. They were only tormenting her, cowards and liars and bloody men, the English generals and their like down there in London. But she wouldn&#8217;t bear it, she&#8217;d have the law on them, cowards and liars as she knew them to be!</p>

<p>It was only then that she knew she was moaning, dreadful to hear; and they heard it outside, John Brigson heard it and nearly went daft, he caught up young Ewan and ran with him into the kitchen and then to the foot of the stairs; and told him to go up to his mother, she wanted him. And young Ewan came, it was his hand tugging at her skirts that brought her out of that moaning coma, and he wasn&#8217;t crying, fearsome the sounds though she made, his face was white and resolute, <i>Mother, mother!</i> She picked him up then and held him close, rocking in an agony of despair because of that look on his face, that lost look and the smouldering eyes he had. <i>Oh Ewan, your father&#8217;s dead!</i> she told him the lie that the world believed. And she wept at last, blindly, freeingly, for a little, old Brigson was to say it was the boy that had saved her from going mad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But throughout Kinraddie the news went underbreath that mad she&#8217;d gone, the death of her man had fair unhinged her. For still she swore it was a lie, that Ewan wasn&#8217;t dead, he could never have died for nothing. Kirsty Strachan and Mistress Munro came up to see her, they shook their heads and said he&#8217;d died fine, for his country and his King he&#8217;d died, young Ewan would grow up to be proud of his father. They said that sitting at tea, with long faces on them, and then Chris laughed, they quivered away from her at that laugh.</p>

<p><i>Country and King? You&#8217;re havering, havering! What have they to do with my Ewan, what was the King to him, what their damned country? Blawearie&#8217;s his land, it&#8217;s not his wight that others fight wars!</i></p>

<p>She went fair daft with rage then, seeing the pity in their faces. And also it was then, and then only, staring through an angry haze at them, that she knew at last she was living a dream in a world gone mad. Ewan was dead, they knew it and she knew it herself; and he&#8217;d died for nothing, for nothing, hurt and murdered and crying for her, maybe, killed for nothing: and those bitches sat and spoke of their King and country&#8230; .</p>

<p>They ran out of the house and down the brae, and, panting, she stood and screamed after them. It was fair the speak of Kinraddie next day the way she&#8217;d behaved, and nobody else came up to see her. But she&#8217;d finished with screaming, she went quiet and cold. Mornings came up, and she saw them come, she minded that morning she&#8217;d sent him away, and she might not cry him back. Noons with their sun and rain came over the Howe and she saw the cruelty and pain of life as crimson rainbows that spanned the horizons of the wheeling hours. Nights came soft and grey and quiet across Kinraddie&#8217;s fields, they brought neither terror nor hope to her now. Behind the walls of a sanity cold and high, locked in from the lie of life, she would live, from the world that had murdered her man for nothing, for a madman&#8217;s gibberish heard in the night behind the hills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then Chae Strachan came home at last on leave, he came home and came swift to Blawearie. She met him out by the kitchen door, a sergeant by then, grown thinner and taller, and he stopped and looked in her frozen face. Then, as her hand dropped down from his, he went past her with swinging kilts, into the kitchen, and sat him down and took off his bonnet. <i>Chris, I&#8217;ve come to tell you of Ewan.</i></p>

<p>She stared at him, waking, a hope like a fluttering bird in her breast. <i>Ewan? Chae&#8212;Chae&#8217;s he&#8217;s not living?</i> And then, as he shook his head, the frozen wall came down on her heart again. <i>Ewan&#8217;s dead, don&#8217;t vex yourself hoping else. They can&#8217;t hurt him more, even this can&#8217;t hurt him, though I swore I&#8217;d tell you nothing about it. But I know right well you should know it, Chris. Ewan was shot as a coward and deserter out there in France.</i></p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Chae had lain in a camp near by and had heard of the thing by chance, he&#8217;d read Ewan&#8217;s name in some list of papers that was posted up. And he&#8217;d gone the night before Ewan was shot, and they&#8217;d let him see Ewan, and he&#8217;d heard it all, the story he was telling her now&#8212;<i>better always to know what truth&#8217;s in a thing, for lies come creeping home to roost on unco rees, Chris quean. You&#8217;re young yet, you&#8217;ve hardly begun to live, and I swore to myself that I&#8217;d tell you it all, that you&#8217;d never be vexed with some twisted bit in the years to come. Ewan was shot as a deserter, it was fair enough, he&#8217;d deserted from the front line trenches.</i></p>

<p>He had deserted in a blink of fine weather between the rains that splashed the glutted rat-runs of the front. He had done it quickly and easily, he told to Chae, he had just turned and walked back. And other soldiers that met him had thought him a messenger, or wounded, or maybe on leave, none had questioned him, he&#8217;d set out at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning and by afternoon, taking to the fields, was ten miles or more from the front. Then the military policemen came on him and took him, he was marched back and court-martialled and found to be guilty.</p>

<p>And Chae said to him, they sat together in the hut where he waited the coming of the morning, <i>But why did you do it, Ewan? You might well have known you&#8217;d never get free.</i> And Ewan looked at him and shook his head, <i>It was that wind that came with the sun, I minded Blawearie, I seemed to waken up smelling that smell. And I couldn&#8217;t believe it was me that stood in the trench, it was just daft to be there. So I turned and got out of it.</i></p>

<p>In a flash it had come on him, he had wakened up, he was daft and a fool to be there; and, like somebody minding things done in a coarse wild dream there had flashed on him memory of Chris at Blawearie and his last days there, mad and mad he had been, he had treated her as a devil might, he had tried to hurt her and maul her, trying in the nightmare to waken, to make her waken him up; and now in the blink of sun he saw her face as last he&#8217;d seen it while she quivered away from his taunts. He knew he had lost her, she&#8217;d never be his again, he&#8217;d known it in that moment he clambered back from the trenches; but he knew that he&#8217;d be a coward if he didn&#8217;t try though all hope was past.</p>

<p>So out he had gone for that, remembering Chris, wanting to reach her, knowing as he tramped mile on mile that he never would. But he&#8217;d made her that promise that he&#8217;d never fail her, long syne he had made it that night when he&#8217;d held her so bonny and sweet and a quean in his arms, young and desirous and kind. So mile on mile on the laired French roads: she was lost to him, but that didn&#8217;t help, he&#8217;d try to win to her side again, to see her again, to tell her nothing he&#8217;d said was his saying, it was the foulness dripping from the dream that devoured him. And young Ewan came into his thoughts, he&#8217;d so much to tell her of him, so much he&#8217;d to say and do if only he might win to Blawearie&#8230; .</p>

<p>Then the military policemen had taken him and he&#8217;d listened to them and others in the days that followed, listening and not listening at all, wearied and quiet. <i>Oh, wearied and wakened at last, Chae, and I haven&#8217;t cared, they can take me out fine and shoot me to-morrow, I&#8217;ll be glad for the rest of it, Chris lost to me through my own coarse daftness. She didn&#8217;t even come to give me a kiss at good-bye, Chae, we never said good-bye; but I mind the bonny head of her down-bent there in the close. She&#8217;ll never know, my dear quean, and that&#8217;s best&#8212;they tell lies about folk they shoot and she&#8217;ll think I just died like the rest; you&#8217;re not to tell her.</i></p>

<p>Then he&#8217;d been silent long, and Chae&#8217;d had nothing to say, he knew it was useless to make try for reprieve, he was only a sergeant and had no business even in the hut with the prisoner. And then Ewan said, sudden-like, it clean took Chae by surprise, <i>Mind the smell of dung in the parks on an April morning, Chae? And the peewits over the rigs? Bonny they&#8217;re flying this night in Kinraddie, and Chris sleeping there, and all the Howe happed in mist.</i> Chae said that he mustn&#8217;t mind about that, he was feared that the dawn was close, and Ewan should be thinking of other things now, had he seen a minister? And Ewan said that an old bit billy had come and blethered, an officer creature, but he&#8217;d paid no heed, it had nothing to do with him. Even as he spoke there rose a great clamour of guns far up in the front, it was four miles off, not more; and Chae thought of the hurried watches climbing to their posts and the blash and flare of the Verey lights, the machine-gun crackle from pits in the mud, things he himself mightn&#8217;t hear for long: Ewan&#8217;d never hear it at all beyond this night.</p>

<p>And not feared at all he looked, Chae saw, he sat there in his kilt and shirt-sleeves, and he looked no more than a young lad still, his head between his hands, he didn&#8217;t seem to be thinking at all of the morning so close. For he started to speak of Blawearie then and the parks that he would have drained, though he thought the land would go fair to hell without the woods to shelter it. And Chae said that he thought the same, there were sore changes waiting them when they went back; and then he minded that Ewan would never go back, and could near have bitten his tongue in half, but Ewan hadn&#8217;t noticed, he&#8217;d been speaking of the horses he&#8217;d had, Clyde and old Bess, fine beasts, fine beasts&#8212;did Chae mind that night of lightning when they found Chris wandering the fields with those two horses? That was the night he had known she liked him well&#8212;<i>nothing more than that, so quick and fierce she was, Chae man, she guarded herself like a queen in a palace, there was nothing between her and me till the night we married. Mind that&#8212;and the singing there was, Chae? What was it that Chris sang then?</i></p>

<p>And neither could remember that, it had vexed Ewan a while, and then he forgot it, sitting quiet in that hut on the edge of morning. Then at last he&#8217;d stood up and gone to the window and said <i>There&#8217;s bare a quarter of an hour now, Chae, you&#8217;ll need to be getting back.</i></p>

<p>And they&#8217;d shaken hands, the sentry opened the door for Chae, and he tried to say all he could for comfort, the foreshadowing of the morning in Ewan&#8217;s young eyes was strange and terrible, he couldn&#8217;t take out his hand from that grip. And all that Ewan said was <i>Oh man, mind me when next you hear the peewits over Blawearie&#8212;look at my lass for me when you see her again, close and close, for that kiss that I&#8217;ll never give her.</i> So he&#8217;d turned back into the hut, he wasn&#8217;t feared or crying, he went quiet and calm; and Chae went down through the hut lines grouped about that place, a farm-place it had been, he&#8217;d got to the lorry that waited him, he was cursing and weeping then and the driver thought him daft, he hadn&#8217;t known himself how he&#8217;d been. So they&#8217;d driven off, the wet morning had come crawling across the laired fields, and Chae had never seen Ewan again, they killed him that morning.</p> <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>This was the story Chae told to Chris, sitting the two of them in the kitchen of Blawearie. Then he moved and got up and she did the same, and like one coming from a far, dark country, she saw his face now, he&#8217;d been all that time but a voice in the dark. And at last she found speech herself <i>Never vex for me or the telling me this, it was best, it was best!</i></p>

<p>She crept up the stairs to their room when he&#8217;d gone, she opened the press where Ewan&#8217;s clothes were, and kissed them and held them close, those clothes that had once been his near as ever he&#8217;d come to her now. And she whispered then in the stillness, with only the beech for a listener, <i>Oh, Ewan, Ewan, sleep quiet and sound now, lad, I understand! You did it for me, and I&#8217;m proud and proud, for me and Blawearie, my dear, my dear&#8212;sleep quiet and brave, for I&#8217;ve understood!</i></p>

<p>The beech listened and whispered, whispered and listened, on and on. And a strange impulse and urge came on Chris Tavendale as she too listened. She ran down the stairs and found young Ewan and kissed him, <i>Let&#8217;s go a jaunt up to the hill.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below them, Kinraddie; above, the hill; the loch shimmering and sleeping in the autumn sun; young Ewan at her feet; the peewits crying down the Howe.</p>

<p>She gave a long sigh and withdrew her hand from the face of the Standing Stone. The mist of memories fell away and the aching urge came back&#8212;for what, for what? Sun and sky and the loneliness of the hills, they had cried her up here&#8212;for what?</p>

<p>And then something made her raise her eyes, she stood awful and rigid, fronting him, coming up the path through the broom. Laired with glaur was his uniform, his face was white and the great hole sagged and opened, sagged and opened, red-glazed and black, at every upwards step he took. Up through the broom: she saw the grass wave with no press below his feet, her lad, the light in his eyes that aye she could bring.</p>

<p>The snipe stilled their calling, a cloud came over the sun. He was close to her now and she held out her hands to him, blind with tears and bright her eyes, the bright weather in their faces, her voice shaping a question that she heard him answer in the rustle of the loch-side rushes as closer his soundless feet carried him to her lips and hands.</p>

<p><i>Oh lassie, I&#8217;ve come home!</i> he said, and went into the heart that was his forever.</p>

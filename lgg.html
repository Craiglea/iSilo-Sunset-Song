<h3>Lewis Grassic Gibbon</h3>

<p>Lewis Grassic Gibbon (13 February 1901 â€“ 7 February 1935), born James Leslie Mitchell, was a Scottish writer.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Auchterless, Aberdeenshire, he started working as a journalist for the Aberdeen Journal and the Scottish Farmer at age 16. In 1919 he joined the Royal Army Service Corps and served in Persia, India and Egypt before enlisting in the Royal Air Force in 1920. In the RAF he worked as a clerk and spent some time in the Middle East. He married Rebecca Middleton in 1925, with whom he settled in Welwyn Garden City. He began writing full-time in 1929. He wrote numerous books and shorter works under both his real name and nom de plume before his early death in 1935 of peritonitis brought on by a perforated ulcer.</p>

<p>Although not recognised during the author&#8217;s lifetime, his trilogy entitled A Scots Quair, and in particular its first book Sunset Song, is considered to be among the defining works of 20th century Scottish Renaissance.</p>

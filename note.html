<h3>A Note</h3>

<p>If the great Dutch language disappeared from literary usage and a Dutchman wrote in German a story of the Lekside peasants, one may hazard he would ask and receive a certain latitude and forbearance in his usage of German. He might import into his pages some score or so untranslatable words and idioms&#8212;untranslatable except in their context and setting; he might mould in some fashion his German to the rhythms and cadence of the kindred speech that his peasants speak. Beyond that, in fairness to his hosts, he hardly could go&#8212;to seek effect by a spray of apostrophes would be both impertinence and mistranslation.</p>

<p>The courtesy that the hypothetical Dutchman might receive from German a Scot may invoke from the great English tongue.</p>
